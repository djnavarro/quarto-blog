  <title>How to run R code in the browser with webR</title>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p>A little over a month ago, the tidyverse blog announced that <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/03/webr-0-1-0/">the 0.1 version of webR had been released</a>, opening up the possibility of running R code client side within a browser. To quote from the announcement,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>By compiling R to WebAssembly a user can visit a website and run R code directly within the web browser, without R installed on their device or a supporting computational R server. All that is required is a normal web server, including the type of cloud hosting service provided by Github Pages or Netlify.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, to put it mildly, extremely cool, and unsurprisingly there was quite a bit of enthusiasm for it on Mastodon.<sup>1</sup> And so, now that I find myself with an unfortunate amount of free time on my hands, I decided to play around with it – just for fun – to see if I could get a better sense of how it works.</p>
<p>I haven’t dived very deep into webR yet, but I managed to get far enough to build a simple cellular automaton simulation using webR, and host it with Netlify at <a href="https://webr-automata.djnavarro.net/">webr-automata.djnavarro.net</a>.<sup>2</sup> If you visit the site, you’ll first see some text asking you to wait for WebR to load, and then a text-based grid with cells coloured in different shades of grey. Over time, the cells change colours and the boundaries between different colour blocks tend to become more coherent, as shown in the sequence of images (time runs from left to right) below:</p>
<div class="column-screen-inset">
<div class="quarto-layout-panel">
<div class="quarto-layout-row quarto-layout-valign-top">
<div class="quarto-layout-cell" style="flex-basis: 33.3%;justify-content: center;">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-04-09_webr/automaton1.png" class="img-fluid"></p>

</div>

<p>If you let the simulation run long enough, eventually one colour comes to dominate the entire grid. It’s not the most exciting or artistic code I’ve ever written, but I have to confess I find it oddly soothing to watch.</p>
<section id="some-background" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="some-background">Some background</h2>
<p>Before diving into the code, it’s probably a good idea to say a little bit about how webR works. If you’re at all like Danielle-from-a-month-ago, you might be approaching this with a very simple mental model. Normally when we run R code, we’re using a copy of the R interpreter that has been installed on a local machine. The R code chunks on this quarto blog are all executed locally, for example: I have a copy of R installed on my laptop, the code is run using this copy of R, and the only thing that gets pushed up to my website is are the HTML documents that quarto creates. None of the R code is executed within the browser. Even when we shift to something fancier like a Shiny app or Posit Cloud, the browser does not execute R code: somewhere there is a server that has R installed, and the computational work is done using that R installation, outside of the browser. The reason for this is awfully simple: browsers don’t ship with a copy of R, so they can’t execute R code! 😢</p>
<p>With that as your mental model, the concept behind webR – in which the browser really does execute R code – feels like dark magic. How can this be?</p>
<p>The answer to this question is, to reduce it to two words, <a href="https://webassembly.org/">web assembly</a>. I’d been vaguely aware of web assembly for a little while, but until webR came into being I hadn’t paid much attention to it. The underlying idea, as described on the website, is as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds fancy, right? Again, if you’re like me, there’s a part of your brain that just shuts down when reading this description. Okay sure, I’ve written code in compiled languages like C, C++, and Rust, so I have a pretty decent sense of what “binary instruction format” refers to… I mean, if you’re compiling your source code to an executable binary file that contains the instructions that a computer will execute then – obviously – the machine needs to understand those binary instructions. Duh. But wtf is a “stack-based virtual machine” and what does it mean to have a “portable compilation target”, and why does that mean I can now write R code for the web?????</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>Okay, I’ll be honest: I don’t really understand the low-level details. But also, I don’t care about them either. What I do care about are the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web assembly is a binary format you can compile source code <em>to</em>.</li>
<li>There are existing compilers like <a href="https://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a> that create web assembly binaries from C and C++</li>
<li>Modern browsers ship with web assembly in the same way they ship with javascript: the browser <em>can</em> execute a wasm binary</li>
<li>The R interpreter is written in C</li>
</ul>
<p>When you put these things together, you can see how webR might (and indeed does) work. It’s entirely possible to take the source code for the R interpreter and use emscripten to compile R itself to web assembly. If there were a wasm version of R, your web page could import it in much the same way that it imports a javascript script, and then that “wasm-R” binary could execute an R script.</p>
<p>What a fabulous idea. Someone should do that. Oh wait… George Stagg already did. That’s precisely what <a href="https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/">webR</a> does. 🤦‍♀️</p>
<p>Of course, if you spend a bit of time thinking about the practicalities of making this work, you start to realise there are some tricky things to manage. How exactly would wasm-R read an R script? How would it interact with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a>?<sup>3</sup> When you’re writing code for the web using javascript, this isn’t an issue: you just write code like this…</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode javascript code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="bu" style="color: null;">document</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">.</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">getElementById</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"the_id_for_a_div"</span>)<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">.</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">innerHTML</span> <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"your_code_here"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>…or whatever. Javascript has a native way of interacting with HTML. Web assembly doesn’t do that, and so the web assembly version of R has that limitation. As a consequence, we have to use javascript as an intermediary. Therein lies a lot of the magic. If you dig into the documentation for webR, what you notice is that the bulk of it is devoted to describing APIs that let webR and javascript interact with each other. It has to be that way if we want a web assembly version of R to have the ability to modify the state of the web page!</p>
<p>Or, to put it another way, if you’re an R developer who wants to write webR code, you’re also going to have to write some javascript that controls the interactions between your (webR interpreted) R code and the HTML document. And, because code execution on the web has a variety of security risks that browsers try hard to mitigate, you’re might guess that you’re going to have a lot of finicky details to manage in order to get your code to run without the browser screaming at you.</p>
<p>So in practice, a lot of what you need to learn if you want to jump from “localR” to webR is going to relate to those issues. It makes sense when you look at it in these terms, and feels kind of obvious in hindsight, but it wasn’t until I started trying to write webR code that I realised that this is how it works.</p>

<section id="making-a-plan" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="making-a-plan">Making a plan</h2>
<p>Okay, that’s enough background. Let’s start building something that tries to make these ideas a bit more concrete. To do that we’ll need to write a simple R application of some kind. If you know anything about me at all, you’d guess (correctly) that the applications I like to make for fun tend to be artistic in nature. I can’t help it… I like creating pretty visuals with R. Unfortunately, this is one of the trickier things to do with webR in its current state of development. It is possible, of course: if you take a look at the <a href="https://webr.r-wasm.org/latest/">webR REPL</a> you’ll see that the webpage has an HTML canvas to which R graphics can be drawn. That’s super cool, but I’m certainly not going to <em>start</em> by trying to implement something like that myself. Instead, I’ll do something simpler: I’ll write an R function that takes text input and produces text output. Then, I’ll do something sneaky and display that text in a way that looks like a picture.</p>
<p>Basically, it’s ASCII art. I’m going to make ASCII art, but becuase its the 21st century I’ll do it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> characters rather than literally using ASCII.</p>

<section id="the-r-code" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-r-code">The R code</h2>
<p>I’ll start by showing the R code. The site contains a script called <code>automaton.R</code> and it defines a function called <code>automaton()</code> that takes a single character string as input, and returns a modified string as output. The string is used as the data to define a two dimensional matrix, with one character per cell, and on each iteration of the simulation, one character is updated by copying the value of one of its neighbours in the grid. Here’s the code:</p>

<p>Now, for the purposes of this post I’m assuming you’re already pretty familiar with writing R code, and I’ve deliberately written this function in a way that doesn’t require a lot of explanation for an R user. It’s all written in base R, I’m not using any fancy packages, and I haven’t made any efforts to make it run quickly. I don’t want any complexity on the R side: all I want for this post is to have some R code that works.</p>

<p>The output here doesn’t look as pretty as the pictures shown at the start of this post, but that’s mostly because the CSS styling for this blog creates white space between lines. On the <a href="https://webr-automata.djnavarro.net/">webr-automata.djnavarro.net</a> site there’s nothing like that so all that white space disappears and the output looks like a shaded grid.</p>
<p>Anyway, the key thing here is that on the website I have this code saved to an R script called <code>automaton.R</code>, and it is this script that webR will need to work with.</p>

<p>The next step in the process is to create a webpage. Or, more precisely, to write an HTML document. I’m going to keep this part extremely simple. The site has an <code>index.html</code> file that only does two things: it creates an div called “grid” that we can modify using javascript, and imports a script called <code>webr-app.js</code> that takes care of any such modifications:</p>

<p>This HTML document provides the skeleton for the webpage, and the <code>webr-app.js</code> script will act as the intermediary between my R code and the HTML document.</p>

<p>Now comes the “fun” part. I need to write some javascript that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Imports webR itself so I can execute R code</li>
<li>Reads my R script from the <code>automaton.R</code> file</li>
<li>Uses webR to call the <code>automaton()</code> R function defined in the file</li>
<li>Updates the state of the HTML document using the output of <code>automaton()</code></li>
</ul>
<p>How do I do this? As much as I love a good murder mystery, I don’t think the mystery novel format is ideal when writing technical documents, so let’s start by revealing the ending. Here’s the complete source code for <code>webr-app.js</code>:</p>

<p>If you’re fluent in javascript you can probably look at this and immediately work out what it does, but not every R user has had the (mis)fortune to work extensively in javascript, so I’ll be kind and try to unpack it a bit! At a high level, this code has the following structure:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode javascript code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'https://webr.r-wasm.org/latest/webr.mjs'</span>)<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">.</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">then</span>(<span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">async</span> ({WebR}) <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">=&gt;</span> {</span>
<span id="cb7-2"></span>
<span id="cb7-3">    <span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;">// use the WebR object to do a bunch of stuff</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"></span>
<span id="cb7-5">})<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>For an R user some of this is a little opaque if you don’t have the javascript concept of a <a href="https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/fundamentals/thenable">thenable</a>, but it’s not too hard to see the intent. The browser is first asked to download webR from the specified URL, and then once this operation has finished proceed to execute the code that follows. More precisely, the <code>.then()</code> method executes whatever function it is passed. In this case the code uses the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Js/js_arrow_function.asp"><code>=&gt;</code> notation</a> to define an anonymous function that takes the <code>WebR</code> object – the interface to webR – as an input argument. So now let’s take a look at what happens when this function is called.</p>
<p>The code starts simple. The first thing it does is define a javascript variable <code>grid</code> that refers to the HTML element that we want our R code to manipulate:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode javascript code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb8-1"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">let</span> grid <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="bu" style="color: null;">document</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">.</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">getElementById</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"grid"</span>)<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we start the R session:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode javascript code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb9-1"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">const</span> webr <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">new</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">WebR</span>()<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">;</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">await</span> webr<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">.</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">init</span>()<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>const</code> and <code>new</code> keywords aren’t interesting: <code>new</code> just means we’re creating a new instance from WebR, and <code>const</code> means it’s a constant. We aren’t going to modify the <code>webr</code> object itself. What we <em>are</em> going to do, however, is use it to initialise a new R session. That’s what <code>webr.init()</code> does. The <code>await</code> keyword is used to tell javascript to wait for this code to finish executing before starting the next instruction. That’s important in javascript because – unlike R – a lot of javascript code runs asynchronously. Javascript is perfectly happy to start a function running (returning a promise object) and moving onto the next line of code without waiting for that function to finish. When calling asynchronous functions, javascript doesn’t wait for the “promise” to resolve unless you explicitly tell it to using the <code>await</code> keyword. In this case, we definitely don’t want to try executing R code until we actually have an R session, so I’ve used <code>await</code> to tell javascript to wait until we have one.</p>
<p>The next step in the process is to have javascript read the source code from the <code>automaton.R</code> file as a string, and then pass that to webr to evaluate. The code below does this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode javascript code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb10-1"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">let</span> automaton <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">await</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">fetch</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'automaton.R'</span>)<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">;</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">await</span> webr<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">.</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">evalR</span>(<span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">await</span> automaton<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">.</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">text</span>())<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Here, the javascript <code>fetch()</code> function takes care of the file read operation, and the <code>webr.evalR()</code> function passes the code to R for evaluation. Once this code finishes, the R session will have the <code>automaton()</code> function defined in the global workspace.</p>
<p>Now that the R session has access to the <code>automaton()</code> function, we can again use <code>webr.evalR()</code> to call this function. If you look back to the way I defined the <code>automaton()</code> function earlier in the post, you’ll notice that if we call it without passing it a string as input, it will create a random string to use as the starting point for the cellular automaton. So that’s what we do in the first line of this snippet:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode javascript code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb11-1"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">let</span> str <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">await</span> webr<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">.</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">evalR</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'automaton()'</span>)</span>
<span id="cb11-2">grid<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">.</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">innerHTML</span> <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> (<span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">await</span> str<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">.</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">toJs</span>())<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">.</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">values</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The second line in this javascript takes the string that the <code>automaton()</code> R function outputs, converts it to a javascript string (that’s what the <code>str.toJs()</code> bit does), and then modifies the HTML document (specifically the <code>grid</code> element defined in the first line of javascript) so that the text displayed on the page corresponds to the string that the R function produced.</p>
<p>The rest of the javascript code is essentially the same trick repeated over and over ad infinitum:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode javascript code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb12-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;">// function to update the state of the grid</span></span>

<p>What I’ve done here is define a javascript function <code>grid_update()</code> that does three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>It reads the string currently displayed on the website (i.e.&nbsp;<code>grid.innerHTML</code>) and uses <code>webr.objs.globalEnv.bind()</code> to create a variable called <code>str</code> in the R workspace that contains the same text.</li>
<li>Next, it uses <code>webr.evalR()</code> to call the R function <code>automaton()</code>, passing the R string <code>str</code> as input, and storing the results as a variable (also called <code>str</code> because I am lazy) on the javascript side.</li>
<li>Finally, it converts the <code>str</code> object to a native javascript string and uses it to update the text displayed on the website (i.e., it modifies <code>grid.innerHTML</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Having defined this function, I now do something extraordinarily lazy: I create an infinite loop that calls <code>grid_update()</code> over and over forever, thereby creating the animation that you see on the website.</p>
<p>And with that we are done. Well, sort of. There are going to be a few details to sort out when we go to deploy this to the web, but that’s the core of our very simple app.</p>

<p>Now for the annoying fiddly bits. If you take a look at the actual source code on <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/webr-automata">github.com/djnavarro/webr-automata</a> you’ll notice that there are a few other files I’ve included. Two of them are completely irrelevant: <code>README.md</code> isn’t part of the web application, and neither is <code>.gitignore</code>. The <code>serve.R</code> function isn’t really part of the app either, it’s just an R script I used to serve the site locally while I was writing the code. The other three files – <code>netlify.toml</code>, <code>webr-serviceworker.js</code>, and <code>webr-worker.js</code> – are relevant. Let’s start by taking a look at the contents of the two javascript files:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>webr-worker.js</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb13" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode javascript code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb13-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">importScripts</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'https://webr.r-wasm.org/latest/webr-worker.js'</span>)<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>webr-serviceworker.js</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb14" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode javascript code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode javascript"><span id="cb14-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">importScripts</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'https://webr.r-wasm.org/latest/webr-serviceworker.js'</span>)<span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">;</span><span class="vs" style="color: #20794D;">```</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Okay, there’s actually not much there. That’s because I’ve copied this code directly from the webR documentation, and there’s no reason why you shouldn’t do likewise! You do need these files in order for the application to work, however, and while I don’t want to go into any detail about what’s going on under the hood here<sup>4</sup> it might be helpful to quickly read up on what <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">web workers</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers">service workers</a> are used for. Basically you need these things to allow webR to do its thing in the background.</p>
<p>Next, let’s take a look at the <code>netlify.toml</code> file:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">

</div>
</div>
<p>As before, I’m not planning to go into detail about what this is all about, but if you’re not familiar with cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) it’s probably helpful to take a read through the Mozilla <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">documentation on CORS</a>. The short version is that these headers are needed to prevent the browser from blocking webR in your application.</p>

<p>Despite being in the very early stages of development I kind of love webR already. One of my big frustrations as someone who writes a lot of R code for data analysis and generative art, and someone who writes a lot of HTML/CSS/javascript code for the web, is that it’s really hard to bring these two worlds together. Literate programming tools like R markdown, jupyter, and quarto are all useful to some extent, because they make it easier to write <em>about</em> R code on the web in a natural way<sup>5</sup>, but they don’t allow you to execute the R code in an interactive way. You can solve this problem by writing Shiny apps, but it’s also a limited solution, because a Shiny app won’t work without a server running a local copy of R, and someone has to pay to keep that server running. Speaking as an unemployed woman who just shut down her kubernetes apps because I’m sure as hell not going to pay for them out of my own pocket, this is not ideal. The thing I’ve always wanted is the ability to create websites that execute R code <em>client-side</em>, in exactly the same way that my sites can execute javascript code within the users browser.</p>
<p>It’s early days, of course, but webR offers the tantalising prospect of making this dream a reality. At long last my R code can live in the browser, and I can really show people what you can do with R.</p>
<p>I’m terribly excited.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p>As I approach four months of unemployment I’m finding I need projects to work on purely for the sake of my mental health. One project that has helped a lot is working on the <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org">ggplot2 book</a> (which I coauthor with Hadley Wickham and Thomas Lin Pedersen). At the moment I’m working on the book chapters that discuss the ggplot2 extension system: it’s been quite a lot of fun. One really nice thing about working on those chapters is that I’ve ended up learning a lot about the <a href="https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/grid/grid.html">grid</a> graphics system upon which ggplot2 is built.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>At this point we’re really not sure how much grid to incorporate into the book, but as a fun side-project I decided to adapt some of it and use it as the basis for a post on generative art.</p>
<section id="what-is-grid" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-grid">What is grid?</h2>
<p>The grid package provides the underlying graphics system upon which ggplot2 is built. It’s one of two quite different drawing systems that are included in base R: base graphics and grid. Base graphics has an imperative “pen-on-paper” model: every function immediately draws something on the graphics device. Much like ggplot2 itself, grid takes a more declarative approach where you build up a description of the graphic as an object, which is later rendered. This declarative approach allows us to create objects that exist independently of the graphic device and can be passed around, analysed, and modified. Importantly, parts of a graphical object can refer to other parts, which allows you to do things like define rectangle A to have width equal to the length of text string B, and so on.</p>
<p>This blog post – and the corresponding section in the book, should we decide to include it – isn’t intended to be a comprehensive introduction to grid. But it does cover many of the core concepts and introduces key terms like grobs, viewports, graphical parameters, and units. Hopefully it will make sense even if you’re completely new to grid.</p>
</section>
<section id="grobs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grobs">Grobs</h2>
<p>To understand how grid works, the first thing we need to talk about are grobs. Grobs (<strong>gr</strong>aphic <strong>ob</strong>jects) are the atomic representations of graphical elements in grid, and include types like points, lines, circles, rectangles, and text. The grid package provides functions like <code>pointsGrob()</code>, <code>linesGrob()</code>, <code>circleGrob()</code>, <code>rectGrob()</code>, and <code>textGrob()</code> that create graphical objects without drawing anything to the graphics device.<sup>2</sup> These functions are vectorised, allowing a single point grob to represent multiple points, for instance:</p>

</div>
<p>Notice that this does not create any output. Much like a ggplot2 plot object, this grob is a declarative description of a set of circles. To trigger a drawing operation we first call <code>grid.newpage()</code> to clear the current graphics device, and then <code>grid.draw()</code> to perform a draw operation:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">grid.newpage</span>()</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">grid.draw</span>(circles)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output-display">

</div>
</div>
<p>In addition to providing geometric primitives, grid also allows you to construct composite objects that combine multiple grobs using <code>grobTree()</code>. Here’s an illustration:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1">squares <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">rectGrob</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">x =</span> x, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">y =</span> y, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">width =</span> r <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">*</span> <span class="fl" style="color: #AD0000;">2.5</span>, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">height =</span>  r <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">*</span> <span class="fl" style="color: #AD0000;">2.5</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-2">composite <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">grobTree</span>(squares, circles)</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">grid.newpage</span>()</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">grid.draw</span>(composite)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-03-31_generative-art-with-grid/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="768"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is also possible to define your own grob classes. You can define a new primitive grob class using <code>grob()</code> or a new composite class using <code>gTree()</code>, and specify special behaviour for your new class. We’ll see an example of this in a moment.</p>
</section>
<section id="viewports" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="viewports">Viewports</h2>
<p>The second key concept in grid is the idea of a viewport. A viewport is a rectangular plotting region that supplies its own coordinate system for grobs that are drawn within it, and can also provide a tabular grid in which other viewports an be nested. An individual grob can have its own viewport or, if none is provided, it will inherit one. In the example below I’ll use <code>viewport()</code> to define three different viewports, one with default parameters, and two more that are rotated around the midpoint by 15 and 30 degrees respectively:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1">vp_default <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">viewport</span>()</span>
<span id="cb4-2">vp_rotate1 <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">viewport</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">angle =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">15</span>)</span>
<span id="cb4-3">vp_rotate2 <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">viewport</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">angle =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">30</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This time around, when we create our composite grobs, we’ll explicitly assign them to specific viewports by setting the <code>vp</code> argument:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1">composite_default <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">grobTree</span>(squares, circles, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">vp =</span> vp_default)</span>
<span id="cb5-2">composite_rotate1 <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">grobTree</span>(squares, circles, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">vp =</span> vp_rotate1)</span>
<span id="cb5-3">composite_rotate2 <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">grobTree</span>(squares, circles, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">vp =</span> vp_rotate2)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>When we plot these two grobs, we can see the effect of the viewport: although <code>composite_default</code> and <code>composite_rotated</code> are comprised of the same two primitive grobs (i.e., <code>circles</code> and <code>squares</code>), they belong to different viewports so they look different when the plot is drawn:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">grid.newpage</span>()</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">grid.draw</span>(composite_default)</span>
<span id="cb6-3"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">grid.draw</span>(composite_rotate1)</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">grid.draw</span>(composite_rotate2)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-03-31_generative-art-with-grid/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" class="img-fluid" width="768"></p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="graphical-parameters" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="graphical-parameters">Graphical parameters</h2>
<p>The next concept we need to understand is the idea of graphical parameters. When we defined the <code>circles</code> and <code>labels</code> grobs, we only specified some of its properties. For example, we said nothing about colour or transparency, and so these properties are all set to their default values. The <code>gpar()</code> function in grid allows you to specify graphical parameters as distinct objects:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1">gpA <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">gpar</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">fill =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"grey30"</span>, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">col =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"white"</span>, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">lwd =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">20</span>)</span>
<span id="cb7-2">gpB <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">gpar</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">fill =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"white"</span>, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">col =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"grey30"</span>, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">lwd =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">20</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="units">Units</h2>
<p>The last core concept that we need to discuss is the grid unit system. The grid package allows you to specify the positions (e.g.&nbsp;<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>) and dimensions (e.g.&nbsp;<code>length</code> and <code>width)</code> of grobs and viewports using a flexible language. In the grid unit system there are three qualitatively different styles of unit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolute units (e.g.&nbsp;centimeters, inches, and points refer to physical sizes).</li>
<li>Relative units (e.g.&nbsp;npc which scales the viewport size between 0 and 1).</li>
<li>Units based on other grobs (e.g.&nbsp;grobwidth).</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>unit()</code> function is the main function we use when specifying units: <code>unit(1, "cm")</code> refers to a length of 1 centimeter, whereas <code>unit(0.5, "npc")</code> refers to a length half the size of the relevant viewport. The unit system supports arithmetic operations that are only resolved at draw time, which makes it possible to combine different types of units: <code>unit(0.5, "npc") + unit(1, "cm")</code> defines a point one centimeter to the right of the center of the current viewport.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-grob-classes">Building grob classes</h2>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of grid, let’s attempt to create our own “transforming” grob class: objects that are circles if they are smaller than some threshold (1cm by default), but transform into squares whenever they are larger than the threshold.<sup>3</sup> This is not the most useful kind of graphical object, but it’s useful for illustrating the flexibility of the grid system. The first step is to write our own constructor function using <code>grob()</code> or <code>gTree()</code>, depending on whether we are creating a primitive or composite object. We begin by creating a “thin” constructor function:</p>

<p>The <code>transGrob()</code> function doesn’t do very much on its own. All it does is ensure that the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>size</code> arguments are grid units, and sets the class name to be “trans”. To define the behaviour of our grob, we need to specify methods for one or both of the generic functions <code>makeContext()</code> and <code>makeContent()</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>makeContext()</code> is called when the parent grob is rendered and allows you to control the viewport of the grob. We won’t need to use that for our surprise grob.</p></li>
<li><p><code>makeContent()</code> is called every time the drawing region is resized and allows you to customise the look of the grob based on the size or other aspect.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because these generic functions use the S3 object oriented programming system, we can define our method simply by appending the class name to the end of the function name. That is, the <code>makeContent()</code> method for our surprise grob is defined by creating a function called <code>makeContent.trans()</code> that takes a grob as input and returns a modified grob as output:</p>

<p>Some of the functions we’ve called here are new, but they all reuse the core concepts that we discussed earlier. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>convertWidth()</code> is used to convert grid units from one type to another.</li>
<li><code>nullGrob()</code> creates a blank grob.</li>
<li><code>gList()</code> creates a list of grobs.</li>
<li><code>setChildren()</code> specifies the grobs that belong to a gTree composite grob.</li>
</ul>
<p>The effect of this function is to ensure that every time the grob is rendered the absolute size of each shape is recalculated. All shapes smaller than the threshold become circles, and all shapes larger than the threshold become squares. To see how this plays out, lets call our new function:</p>

<p>The <code>trans</code> grob contains shapes whose locations and sizes have been specified relative to the size of the viewport. At this point in time we have no idea which of these shapes will be circles and which will be squares, because that depends on the size of the viewport in which the <code>trans</code> grob is to be drawn.

<section id="pushing-viewports" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pushing-viewports">Pushing viewports</h2>
<p>A nice feature of grid is that viewports can be nested within other viewports. At the top level there is always “root” viewport that encompasses the entire image. By default user-created viewports are children of the root viewport, and inherit properties from it. However, there’s nothing stopping you from assigning new viewports to be children of previous user-generated viewports. In the simplest case<sup>4</sup>, we can use this to create a <em>viewport stack</em> in which each new viewport is the child of the previous one. The <code>pushViewport()</code> function allows us to do this.</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<p>In this code I define <code>vp</code> to be a viewport that shrinks the width and height of the current viewport to be 80% of its parent, and rotates the frame by 17 degrees.b Then I repeatedly push <code>vp</code> to the viewport stack, and draw a border (the <code>box</code> grob) showing the edges of that viewport. The effects of each push to the stack are cumulative, as the image shows.</p>
<p>It’s also quite pretty.</p>
<p>The grid package has a lot of tools for working with viewport lists, stacks, and trees. You can assign names to viewports, navigate back and forth between different viewports during plot construction, and so on. But that’s a topic for another day.</p>

<p>I’m pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to create interesting generative art with grid. As a really simple example, here’s a system that combines two tricks: it uses the <code>transGrob()</code> that we defined earlier, and it uses a viewport stack to create spiraling images:</p>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I made a little shiny app based on this post: <a href="https://djnavarro.shinyapps.io/shattered-landscapes/">djnavarro.shinyapps.io/shattered-landscapes</a> (<a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/quarto-blog/blob/main/posts/2023-03-13_shattered-landscapes/app.R">source code</a>). It doesn’t implement the complete system because rayshader causes out of memory problems for my free tier shinyapps account, but in other respects it’s the same thing.</p>
<p><br></p>

<p>In the last few weeks I’ve been tinkering with a generative art system I ended up calling <a href="https://art.djnavarro.net/gallery/broken-lands/"><em>Broken Lands</em></a>. It creates maps of bizarre and impossible landscapes in R, using the <a href="https://ambient.data-imaginist.com/">ambient</a> package to generate the topography, and <a href="https://www.rayshader.com/">rayshader</a> to render shadows cast by a hypothetical light source. It creates images like these:</p>
<div class="column-screen-inset">
<div class="quarto-layout-panel">
<div class="quarto-layout-row quarto-layout-valign-top">
<div class="quarto-layout-cell" style="flex-basis: 33.3%;justify-content: center;">

</div>
<div class="quarto-layout-cell" style="flex-basis: 33.3%;justify-content: center;">

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>To my eye, at least, these images are both beautiful and tragic. I cannot help but interpret them as coastal landscapes in an alien geography of some kind, a land that has suffered some cataclysm like the <a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria">Doom of Valyria</a> or the <a href="https://dragonlancenexus.com/the-rise-and-demise-of-istar/">Fall of Istar</a>. The contours feel too contorted to be the result of any terrestrial process, and – again, by my interpretation – there’s a tension between the smoothness of the individual contours and the jagged, chaotic structure of the landscape overall.</p>
<p>But what would I know? I wrote the code that makes the system work, but I don’t have a monopoly of interpretation of the images. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author">Death of the author</a> and all that. Barthes would call me the “scriptor” rather than the author, I suppose, which honestly feels about right for generative art. So yeah. The pieces are what they are, quite separate from the artist and from the process by which the system was constructed.</p>
<p>That said, if you’re familiar with the R ecosystem you can probably take an educated guess about how I made these pieces. As mentioned at the start, the spatial noise patterns are created using the <a href="https://ambient.data-imaginist.com/">ambient</a> package and the shadows and three-dimensional look are provided by <a href="https://www.rayshader.com/">rayshader</a>. I wrote about both of these packages in my workshop on <a href="https://art-from-code.netlify.app/">generative art in R</a> workshop (specifically: <a href="https://art-from-code.netlify.app/day-1/session-2/">ambient art</a>, <a href="https://art-from-code.netlify.app/day-1/session-4/">rayshader art</a>), and those tutorials provide a lot of clues about how these pieces are made. But there are also some details I haven’t talked about before, and in any case it’s always fun to write about art.</p>

<p>I’ll start by building a simple system that doesn’t go very far beyond what I covered in the <em>Art From Code</em> workshop. It’s built using three functions. There’s a <code>new_grid()</code> function used to define a grid of x and y coordinates, a <code>generate_simplex()</code> function used to create spatial noise patterns on such a grid, and a <code>render()</code> function used to create an image. First, the <code>new_grid()</code> function:</p>

<p>The particular choices I’ve made here came about from trial and error. I played around with a lot of different settings when creating generative art in this style, and these were things I liked. I’m not going to dive into the details here: you can find out more by reading the <a href="[ambient art](https://art-from-code.netlify.app/day-1/session-2/)">tutorial on spatial noise art</a> I linked to earlier. For the current post, all I want to highlight is that we can use this function to add a new column to the <code>canvas</code> that defines our artwork:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1">canvas <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">new_grid</span>() <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span> </span>

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

<p>This <code>canvas</code> object is structured like a lookup table: it’s a data frame with columns specifying x and y coordinates, and it contains a third column that specifies the colour of “paint” that needs to be applied at each coordinate. However, it’s a very structured data frame because the x and y values form a grid. This makes straightforward to flip from this format to a “bitmap” matrix format:<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>A grid of numbers isn’t very pretty to look at, but we will need to create this matrix representation before passing the data to rayshader later. But I’m getting ahead of myself. For now, we can use the <code>image()</code> function to render an image from matrix-formatted data:</p>

<p>We’re a long way from our goal, but at least we now have an output that looks like art rather than a matrix of numbers. It’s a start!</p>

<p>The next step in the process is to define a <code>render()</code> function that will take an “elevation” matrix as input, but instead of drawing a “heat map” like <code>image()</code> does, it renders it as a three-dimensional topographic map with shadows cast by a hypothetical light source. This is surprisingly easy to do using rayshader. Here’s the function I’ll use in this post:</p>

<p>I’m not going to go into the specifics: you can find out more by reading the <a href="[ambient art](https://art-from-code.netlify.app/day-1/session-4/)">tutorial on rayshader art</a> I linked to earlier. For this post, I’m simply going to show you what it does. Taking the <code>canvas</code> data as input, we first use <code>as.array()</code> to switch from a “data frame style” representation to a “matrix style” representation, and then pass the matrix to <code>render()</code>:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/render-landscape_59c4a810d191eb5a7228c812793b479f">

<p>Again, still a long way from our desired goal, but we are making progress. Thanks to rayshader, we have output that looks like a shaded topographic map.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="making-islands-from-the-landscape">Making islands from the landscape</h3>
<p>At this point we have the ability to generate landscapes, but the images just look like a bunch of hills. They don’t have the “coastal” feeling that the original images did. We can create islands by setting a “sea level”. You can do this in a sophisticated way in rayshader using <code>detect_water()</code> and <code>add_water()</code>, but that’s overkill for our purposes. All we really want to do is imagine setting a sea level such that about half the image is “water” and half the image is “land”. To do that we just calculate the median value in the original data:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb12" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb12-1">sea_level <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">median</span>(canvas<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span>paint)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>From there it’s an exercise in using dplyr. Using <code>mutate()</code> we create a new “islands” column whose value is equal to the original value or the sea level, whichever is higher:</p>

<p>Et voilà! We have a generative art system that creates fictitious topographic maps of coastal islands. It’s still not quite the same thing as the original, but it’s kind of a nice system in itself. If you want to play with it, the complete source code for generating this image is included in the <a href="islands.R">islands.R</a> script accompanying this post.</p>

<p>If you do end up playing around, a really useful way to create variations on this system is to modify the function that generates the spatial noise patterns. For example, this <code>generate_fancy_noise()</code> function is awfully similar to the noise generator I used in the <em>Broken Lands</em> series:</p>

<p>Very pretty. I suspect that had I isolated this particular noise generator earlier in the artistic process – rather than figuring out in hindsight that this was what I’d been using all along – I might have stopped here, and not bothered with any of the other tricks that I used.<sup>4</sup> But of course this is a post-mortem deconstruction, not a description of the bizarrely tangled artistic process I actually followed, so there are more layers to come…</p>

<p>The final image in the last section captures something about the overall structure of the <em>Broken Lands</em> images, but it feels wrong in the particulars. It’s too smooth, too fluid, too… natural. It doesn’t have the same feel as the originals. I don’t have the same feeling of alienness that the original pieces have. Where does that not-quite-real feeling come from?</p>
<p>The answer to this involves every generative artists favourite trick: curl fields. If you’ve read the tutorial articles I linked to earlier, you’ve encountered these before so I won’t repeat myself by explaining yet again what a curl field is. What I’ll do instead is write a <code>generate_curl()</code> function that takes the original grid of coordinates (in the “base” space) and transforms them to a new set of points (in an “embedding” space) using a curl transformation:<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>The code here is slightly unpleasant, yes, but I’ll do it in a slightly cleaner way in a moment. What matters right now is the fact that the <code>coords</code> data frame is a transformed version of the <code>grid</code> data. The original (x,y) coordinates in the base space have been transformed to some (x,y) coordinates in some new space.</p>
<p>A slightly cleaner way of doing this – keeping both the original coordinates and the transformed values – would be as follows:</p>

<p>Just to give you a sense of what that looks like in the embedding space, here’s what happens when we redraw the “manifold” plot from above, with each point coloured using the value of the “islands” variable:</p>

<p>You can sort of see what’s going on here. We have a spatial noise pattern that generated the topography that I showed in the last section, but it’s defined on the <em>embedding</em> space. Our <em>base</em> space is like a rectangular fabric that has been laid and folded over and over onto this embedding space, and then we’ve spray painted this pattern onto the fabric.<sup>6</sup> <sup>7</sup> <sup>8</sup> When we unfold the spray painted fabric and lay it flat again, this is what we get:</p>

<p>It’s a bit like tie-dyeing I guess? That’s what it feels like to me. I’m taking something regular, scrunching it up in a strange way, and then applying the colours to the scrunched up object before unfolding it.</p>

<p>Okay now <em>that</em> feels like an alien geography to me! It still doesn’t look at all like our final images, but it has the right feel to it. Yes, it’s still a geography of sorts, but it feels stretched and twisted in an unnatural way. It feels… well, it feels <em>painful</em>. Nothing like this can occur naturally without the action of some catastrophic process. That’s what it feels like to me. The “brokenness” of the original images is created by this transformation: natural-ish patterns imposed on a twisted space create bizarre and alien patterns when those contortions are unfolded. It feels weird… it feels strange… it feels queer.<sup>9</sup></p>

<p>The last image in the previous section doesn’t look all that much like the <em>Broken Lands</em> pieces, but – perhaps surprisingly – we’re weirdly close to creating something that really does look like those pieces. There are no deep insights left to explore. From here on out, it’s really just a matter of applying a few artistic tricks. To be precise, there are three little tricks left to document.</p>
<p><br></p>
<section id="be-discreette" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="be-discreette">Be discre[et|te]</h3>
<p>The first trick is discretisation. So far we’ve been creating images in which the “elevation” of the landscapes vary smoothly. The <em>Broken Lands</em> images don’t do that. Instead, there is a distinct feeling that the lands are terraced. In the original pieces there’s that same unnatural terracing that that you see in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-pit_mining">open cut mining</a>.<sup>10</sup> Creating that look in this system is not difficult. First, I’ll define a <code>discretise()</code> function that takes a continuously-varying vector as input, cuts it into <code>n</code> distinct levels that vary in value between 0 and 1, and returns the discretised values:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb25" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb25-1">discretise <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">function</span>(x, n) {</span>

<span id="cb25-3">}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here’s an example in which 100 normally distributed numbers are sliced into 5 levels:</p>
<div class="cell">

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

<p>To create a discretised version of our alien landscapes, all we have to do is liberally pepper our original code with a few calls to <code>discretise()</code>. Here’s an example:</p>

<p>This terracing has the effect of levelling out some of the more bizarre features of the alien landscape we plotted earlier. Here’s what we get when we pass this terraced landscape to our <code>render()</code> function:</p>

<p>Ah, yes. Now we have something that feels closer to the <em>Broken Lands</em> pieces. The twists and contortions of the alien landscape are preserved, but they have now been forced onto a flatter, controlled geometry. The chaos of the alien land has been tamed. This is a domesticated variant. Safe for children and capitalists alike.</p>

<p>At some level I appreciate the stark feel of the previous piece, but even I am not enough of a masochist<sup>11</sup> to truly enjoy the brutality of what I just did. All those intricate alien swirls have been flattened and erased so crudely that we are left with something a little too minimal for my tastes.</p>
<p>And so to the second artistic sleight-of-hand: some of the starkness of the last piece can be ameliorated if we apply noise processes in both the embedding space (i.e., noise is applied to <code>curl_x</code> and <code>curl_y</code>) and in the base space (i.e., to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>). The code for that might look a little like this:</p>

<p>There is no principle to this. No deep underlying logic. It is simply an attempt to paper over the cracks, to smooth out some of the raw, sharp edges that were left over when we discretised in the first step.</p>

<p>The final layer of trickery involves the colour palette. Throughout this post I’ve used the default “yellow and red” palette that <code>image()</code> uses to create heat map images, but the <code>render()</code> function I wrote at the beginning lets you choose your own colour scheme. For instance, let’s say I want the land to vary smoothly along a “teal and green” colour palette, while having the water stay white (or thereabouts). It’s surprisingly straightforward to do this, by passing a hand crafted vector of colours to <code>render()</code>:</p>

<p>This is so very, very close to the style of imagery in the original <em>Broken Lands</em> series. The only thing missing is a slight feeling of chaos to the colours. If you scroll back up to the top of the post you’ll notice that the original images don’t quite adhere to the smoothly-varying-shades feel of a proper topographic map. The reason for this is that I shuffled the colour palette, so each “level” in the discrete map has a randomly sampled colour from the palette. Here’s some code that does precisely that:</p>

<p>… and there it is. This version of the system isn’t precisely equivalent to the original, but it mirrors it in every respect that matters to me. The magic is all laid bare. There are no artistic secrets left in this system. Everything you need to know about these images is committed to text. Documented. Described. Codified.</p>
<p>I love the originals no less now that the magic is revealed. There is no art in secrecy.</p>

<p>Much like the <em>Broken Lands</em> system itself,<sup>13</sup> this post has a peculiar genesis. If you read the <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-12-26_strange-year/">strange year</a> post I wrote a few months ago, you’d be unsurprised to hear that I am attempting to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle">square a few circles</a> right now. Something broke – rather badly – and I’m trying to work out how to put the pieces together even knowing that the shattered parts can’t go back together in the shape they were before. Aspects to my life that were once central to my sense of self are scattered, and there are little slivers of glass laid everywhere – when I attempt to pick up one of the pieces from the floor I get cut deeply by those tiny transparent needles.</p>
<p>This post is one of those attempts. One of the pieces I need to pick up is my writing. The little cataclysm of 2022 broke my writing. I didn’t become a bad writer, or at least I don’t think I did. I hope I didn’t! Rather, I lost my sense of ownership over my writing. I felt like I was writing for others rather than myself, as if my blog were a product to be optimised rather than a thing I write because I love writing. It’s been some work trying to reconnect with the joy of writing for my own purposes.</p>
<p>And so to the point…</p>
<p>I wrote this post because I loved creating the artwork, and it’s written the way it is written because it makes me happy to write again. That’s it. It’s something I wrote because I want to own my words again. There’s no “take home message”. There’s no “call to action”. You can love it, or hate it, or ignore it. That’s okay. I didn’t write it for you – I wrote it for me.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Also Lev Grossman I guess, but honestly Hale Appleman’s delivery is so good that I cannot possibly attribute the quote to anyone except Eliot.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>It’s actually a slightly different kind of object called a “long grid” but for now I’ll treat it like a tibble↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Okay that’s not quite correct. The <code>as.array()</code> method works here because we created this object by calling <code>ambient::long_grid()</code> rather than <code>tidyr::expand_grid()</code> or the <code>expand.grid()</code> function in base R. When you call <code>expand_grid()</code> all you’re doing is creating a regular data frame (or tibble), and you can redefine the x and y values however you like. With a long grid object, however, you’re creating a somewhat different data structure that is <em>required</em> to form a grid. You can’t modify the x and y values the same way you would for a tibble, because those values are part of the underlying data structure. That seems like an odd restriction the first time you encounter it, but the fact that the grid itself is immutable is what makes it trivially easy to call <code>as.array()</code> in this context.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Easter egg for the three people who know the reference: I rather suspect that what I’ve done in this section is create the artistic version of the “linear ballistic accumulator” model of human choice behaviour, where my original system was a full fledged diffusion model. Happily for all concerned, neither Scott nor Roger are going to read this post.↩︎</p></li>

  <title>Fun and games with p5.js and observable.js in quarto</title>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<blockquote class="blockquote">

</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so… I write this blog using <a href="https://quarto.org/">quarto</a>, and quarto has native support for <a href="https://observablehq.com">observable.js</a> … and observable.js supports third-party javascript libraries such as <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a> executing in code cells… so, like… I can use p5.js to create generative art, inside the browser, inside a blog post? Right?</p>
<p>Apparently the answer to that is yes.</p>
<p>There is but one tiny problem. I don’t know anything about observable.js or p5.js. I supposed I’d best remedy that.</p>
<section id="enabling-p5js" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="enabling-p5js">Enabling p5js</h2>
<p>The first step in the process is enabling p5.js, which is not one of the core libraries in observable, and is not immediately available. To use a third-party library that exists as an <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules">NPM modules</a> we can import it using <code>require()</code>.</p>
<div class="cell" data-output="all">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" data-startfrom="48" data-source-offset="0" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode js code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode javascript" style="counter-reset: source-line 47;"><span id="cb1-48">P5 <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="pp" style="color: #AD0000;">require</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"p5"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display">
<div id="ojs-cell-1" data-nodetype="declaration">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Just like that, thanks to the joy of the <a href="https://www.jsdelivr.com/">jsDelivr CDN</a>, p5.js is now available to me in this post.</p>
<p>Well, sort of. As you can see from the output,<sup>1</sup> the <code>P5</code> object is a function that takes three inputs. To do anything useful with it, I’ll use a trick I learned from <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/p5">this fabulous notebook by Tom MacWright</a> to run p5.js in “instance mode”. Normally, p5.js works by defining a lot of global objects. That works fine if you’re only doing one “sketch” on a single page, but it’s not so clean if you want to write modular code where a single page (like this one) could contain multiple p5.js sketches.</p>
<p>To run p5.js in instance mode, and in a way that plays nicely with observable.js and quarto, I’ll define <code>createSketch</code> as a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*">generator function</a>:</p>

<p>Using this approach, each instantiation of <code>P5</code> is attached to a div element that created when <code>createSketch</code> is called. If you want to know more about how this approach works, it’s probably best to go to the original source that I adapted it from, because Tom has commented it and explained it nicely: <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/p5">observablehq.com/<span class="citation" data-cites="tmcw/p5">@tmcw/p5</span></a></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="donut-1">Donut 1</h2>
<p>In keeping with the tradition I’ve set up in the last few blog posts, all the examples are donut themed.<sup>2</sup> When calling <code>createSketch</code> I’ll pass an anonymous function that takes a single argument <code>s</code>, the document element to which all the p5 functions are attached. I’ll use the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrow_function.asp">arrow notation</a>, so my code is going to look something like this:</p>
<div class="cell" data-eval="false">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" data-startfrom="80" data-source-offset="0" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode js code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode javascript" style="counter-reset: source-line 79;"><span id="cb3-80"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">createSketch</span>(s <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">=&gt;</span> {</span>
<span id="cb3-81">  <span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;">// add some p5.js code </span></span>
<span id="cb3-82">})</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display">
<div id="ojs-cell-3" data-nodetype="expression">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The idea in p5.js is all the work is done by two functions. The <code>setup</code> function includes code that is called only once, and if you want to draw static images you can do everything at the setup stage. In contrast the <code>draw</code> function is called repeatedly, so you can use that to add dynamic elements.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a static sketch that draws a single donut shape using two circles:</p>

<p>In this example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>createCanvas</code> creates the drawing area in which the sketch will be rendered. Arguments are the width and height in pixels</li>
<li><code>background</code> sets the background colour. The colour specification is flexible: it can be a recognised colour name, a hex string, or a numeric RGB specification</li>
<li><code>fill</code> sets the fill colour</li>
<li><code>circle</code> draws a circle: the first two arguments specify the origin of the circle, and the third argument specifies the diameter</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve used <a href="https://dev.to/isiakaabd/method-chaining-in-javascript-154a">method chaining</a> here to remind me that the first <code>fill</code> and the first <code>circle</code> go together: writing <code>s.fill("red").circle(250, 250, 100)</code> on a single line helps me group code together conceptually. It’s mostly for my own convenience though.</p>

<p>Okay Danielle, that’s nice but it’s not <em>that</em> nice. Can we do something a little more interesting? Maybe with some dynamics? Well okay, Other Danielle, since you asked so sweetly, here’s an example with a moving circle that changes colour and traces out a donut shape:</p>

<p>This example makes use of some geometry functions included in p5.j (<code>sin</code>, <code>cos</code>, <code>translate</code>), a random number generator (<code>random</code>), and timer that returns the number of milliseconds since the sketch started (<code>millis</code>). These are all documented in the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">p5.js reference</a>.</p>

<p>For the third example we’ll introduce some fonts, adapting an example from <a href="https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/p5">observablehq.com/<span class="citation" data-cites="tmcw/p5">@tmcw/p5</span></a>. First, I’ll add some CSS to import the Courgette font:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode css code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode css"><span id="cb6-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">@import</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">url(</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Courgette</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">)</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<style type="text/css">

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The donuts app is no longer live. It was starting to cost me money! :-)</p>

<p>Story time. There was a very weird moment in machine learning history, about 20 years ago, when the probabilistic AI folks were completely obsessed with Bayesian nonparametrics, and a disproportionate number of papers at NeurIPS had titles like “[Cutesy prefix]: An infinite dimensional model of [something really boring]”. In most cases, you’d dig into the paper and discover that they hadn’t done anything very special. All they’d done is implement a Bayesian model of [boring thing] that was ambiguous about the number of [components], and instead of thinking about what prior constraints make sense for the problem they were trying to solve, the authors used a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_restaurant_process">Chinese restaurant process</a> (CRP) to specify the conditional prior distribution over allocations of observations to components. The CRP has the mildly-interesting property that for any finite sample size there is a non-negligible conditional probability that the next observation belongs to a hitherto unobserved component, and asymptotically the partitions over observations it generates have a countably infinite number of components. Alas, exactly zero of these papers happened to have an infinitely large data set to train the model on, and without fail the results in the papers didn’t appear to have anything “infinite dimensional” about them whatsoever.</p>
<p>I say this with love and gentleness, dear reader, because I wrote quite a few of those papers myself.</p>
<p>Why do I tell this story in a blog post that has absolutely nothing to do with machine learning, statistics, or Bayesian inference? Because in a fit of pique, somewhere around 2006, I decided to do the damned reading myself and learned quite a lot of Bayesian nonparametrics. Not because I thought it would be useful, but because I was curious and I was getting extremely irritated at overconfident machine learning boys telling me that as a mere psychologist I couldn’t possibly understand the depth of their thinking.</p>
<p>Which brings me, naturally enough, to <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">kubernetes</a>.</p>

<p>Let’s start at the ending, shall we? The art shown below is generated at <a href="https://donut.djnavarro.net">donut.djnavarro.net</a>, and it is more-or-less unique. The site is designed to serve a different image every time it is accessed, using the timestamp as the seed to a generative art system written in R with ggplot2. If you refresh this page, the artwork will change:</p>
<a href="https://donut.djnavarro.net"><img width="100%" src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-01-10_kubernetes/https:/donut.djnavarro.net" title="donut.djnavarro.net"></a>
<p><br></p>
<p>Under the hood, the site is a kubernetes app running containerised R code with google kubernetes engine. Sounds fancy, right?</p>
<p>Well, maybe. Shall we take a look at how it works? Perhaps, like so many other things in this world, it will turn out not to be anywhere near as complicated as it is made out to be.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="um.-what-is-kubernetes-do-i-care">Um. What is kubernetes? Do I care?</h2>
<p>There’s nothing I love more than looking at the website for a software tool and trying to work out what it does by reading how the developers have chosen to describe it. On the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">kubernetes</a> website they’ve gone with the headline <em>“Production-Grade Container Orchestration”</em>, and started with this:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As opening lines go it wouldn’t get you a lot of attention on grindr<sup>1</sup> but context makes a difference and it’s not so terrible as a description of what kubernetes does. It’s a useful tool if you need to deploy an application on a cluster<sup>2</sup> and have that application run smoothly as you “scale” your cluster by adding more “nodes”<sup>3</sup> to the cluster. For the application I’m about to write, kubernetes is overkill. I don’t actually need kubernetes to run something this simple, but this is a learning exercise. I’m doing it so that I can familiarise myself with core concepts. When I get to the part of the post that actually <em>does</em> something with kubernetes I’ll start introducing terminology, but for now that’s enough for us.</p>
<p>Should you care as an R user? I mean, probably not. If you want a proper answer, Roel Hogervorst has an excellent blog post called <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/04/wtf-is-kubernetes-and-should-i-care-as-r-user/"><em>“WTF is Kubernetes and Should I Care as R User?”</em></a> I won’t duplicate content here: you should read the original post. But the short answer is that you probably won’t need to run your own application using kubernetes, but you might need to contribute code to a larger application that uses it. If so, you may want to play around with kubernetes to make sure you understand what it does.</p>

<p>Let’s begin at the beginning. Anytime you want to write something, it helps to have something to say. There is nothing more tiresome than an op-ed writer trying to fill out 1000 words to make the Saturday paper deadline, but tech writing that tries to demonstrate a tool<sup>5</sup> without anything even remotely resembling an application runs a very close second. So let’s at least <em>pretend</em> we have a use case for this yeah?</p>
<p>In real life I am an unemployed 40-something woman who smokes and drinks too much and makes very poor choices around men, but in my spare moments I make <a href="https://art.djnavarro.net/">generative art</a> using R. It’s an extremely unprofitable hobby<sup>6</sup> but it’s not completely without market value. Among other things the lovely folks at Posit were kind enough to pay me to put together an <a href="https://art-from-code.netlify.app">“art from code”</a> workshop last year, and thanks to their kindness and my weird priorities there is now a nice little online tutorial that you can use to learn how to make generative art in R. What I’m going to do in this post is build a little kubernetes app that creates generative in R. It won’t be very fancy, but hopefully you can see how an app like this could be expanded<sup>7</sup> to create a platform for “long form generative art” with R, not dissimilar to what <a href="https://www.artblocks.io/">artblocks</a> or <a href="https://www.fxhash.xyz/">fxhash</a> allow generative artists to do with javascript. The artist supplies code (in this case using R) that generates artwork, and the server uses that code to generate an arbitrary number of pieces that… idk, I guess you could sell them? Whatever. Do I look like a capitalist to you?</p>
<p>To build something like this we’ll need some R code that creates generative art. I won’t try to make anything too fancy here. In fact, I’ll reuse code for the “donuts” system I used in my <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/queue/">multi-threaded task queues post</a>. It’s a good choice for this application because the donuts system is something that is extremely easy to implement in R because the ggplot2 package provides tooling for creating data visualisations that use polar geometry<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Here’s how you build the system. I won’t go into detail because this system is a very minor variation on <a href="https://art-from-code.netlify.app/day-1/session-1/#composition">this one in my art-from-code tutorial</a>, but here’s the gist. First, the plot is going to need a colour scheme, so we’ll define a function that samples a palette randomly with the assistance of the ggthemes package:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>server.R</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" data-startfrom="4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource r numberLines number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r" style="counter-reset: source-line 3;"><span id="cb1-4">sample_canva <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">function</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">seed =</span> <span class="cn" style="color: #8f5902;">NULL</span>) {</span>
<span id="cb1-5">  <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">if</span>(<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">!</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">is.null</span>(seed)) <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">set.seed</span>(seed)</span>
<span id="cb1-6">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">sample</span>(ggthemes<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">::</span>canva_palettes, <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span>)[[<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span>]]</span>
<span id="cb1-7">}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Next, we’ll have a function that generates a table full of random numbers that we will later on map onto various plot aesthetics to make a pretty picture:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Are you posting hole on main again? <br> &nbsp; – Everyone who knows me, eventually</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next step in the process is to define a public API that specifies how visitors to the website can interact with the underlying R code. That’s not something we typically do with R code because we aren’t usually in the business of writing web applications in R, but thanks to endless joy that is the <a href="https://www.rplumber.io/">plumber</a> this task can be accomplished with a few lines of code decoration:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>server.R</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb6" data-startfrom="91" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource r numberLines number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r" style="counter-reset: source-line 90;"><span id="cb6-91"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;">#* draws a donut plot</span></span>

<span id="cb6-93"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;">#* @get /</span></span>
<span id="cb6-94"><span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">function</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">seed =</span> <span class="cn" style="color: #8f5902;">NA</span>) {</span>
<span id="cb6-95">  <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">if</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">is.na</span>(seed)) {</span>
<span id="cb6-96">    seed <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">as.integer</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">Sys.time</span>())</span>
<span id="cb6-97">  }</span>
<span id="cb6-98">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">print</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">donut</span>(seed))</span>
<span id="cb6-99">}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are a few things to note here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The code decoration on line 93 specifies that the function defined in lines 94-99 will be called whenever an HTML <code>GET</code> request is sent to the <code>/</code> endpoint. Or, in simpler language, whenever someone visits the main page for the website that eventually ended up being hosted at <a href="https://donut.djnavarro.net">donut.djnavarro.net</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The code decoration on line 92 how the output from the R function (an in-memory data structure) will be serialised (to a binary stream) and transmitted to the user.<sup>9</sup> In this case, the output is a plot object that would normally be handled by the R graphics device. What I’ve used plumber to do here, is have this output converted to an svg file. It’s that svg file that the website will serve to the user.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, notice that the function does take a <code>seed</code> argument.<sup>10</sup> I’ve set <code>NA</code> as the default value rather than the more conventional <code>NULL</code> because plumber won’t accept a <code>NULL</code> default in this context.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Noting that all the code I’ve presented so far belongs to a file called <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/donut/blob/main/server.R"><code>server.R</code></a> (the link goes to the github repo for this “donut” side-project), I can start the web server running locally on port 3456 like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1">plumber<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">plumb</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">file=</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"server.R"</span>)<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">run</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">port =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">3456</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<section id="containerise-it" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="containerise-it">Containerise it</h2>
<p>At this point in the process I have a perfectly functional webserver… that only runs on my machine which just happens to have the dependencies installed, and is only accessible locally from that machine. We’ll need to fix both of those problems.</p>
<p>Let’s start by fixing the first one by running the website from within a docker container. Under normal circumstances I’d walk you through that process, but since I wrote a <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/playing-with-docker/">long blog post about docker</a> just the other day, I’ll jump straight to showing you the <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/donut/blob/main/Dockerfile"><code>Dockerfile</code></a>:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Every instruction in this dockerfile is something I covered in the last post, except for the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose"><code>EXPOSE</code></a> instruction on line 10. That one tells the container to listen on port 80. It doesn’t necessarily publish the output anywhere accessible from outside the container<sup>11</sup> but it does mean that the plumber web server running inside the container is listening on port 80 and can create a response when it receives a request. I’ll deal with the publishing issue later.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="push-it-to-the-registry">Push it to the registry</h2>
<p>The next step in the process is to host the image created from this dockerfile on a public registry.<sup>12</sup> I talked about that process in the last post too, so again I’ll keep things simple. The process I followed for the donut project is essentially identical to the one I used in this <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-01-01_playing-with-docker/#hosting-images">section of the docker post</a>. I’ve created a github actions workflow that automatically builds the image on github and hosts it with the github container registry. The resulting image name is <code>ghcr.io/djnavarro/donut:main</code> and here’s the <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/donut/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-image.yaml"><code>build-image.yaml</code></a> workflow I’m using:</p>

<p>At long, long last we have all the precursors in place. We have a little web application that runs inside a docker container, and the image describing that container is hosted on a registry.<sup>13</sup> We can get started on the kubernetes side of things…</p>

<section id="create-a-kubernetes-cluster" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-a-kubernetes-cluster">Create a kubernetes cluster</h2>
<p>At the risk of stating the bloody obvious, if you want to use kubernetes to deploy an application on a cluster… you’re probably going to need a cluster running kubernetes. You can get yourself one of these in lots of different ways but the way I’m going to do it is with GKE, the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">google kubernetes engine</a>. You’ll need a google account to do this, and yes this is something that they charge actual money for, but the good news is that when you sign up for google cloud services you get a few hundred dollars of credit to start with. That’s pretty useful for novices: it’s nice to be able to play around and learn the basics before you have to start worrying about what it’s going to cost.</p>
<p>If you go down that path you can access your projects from the cloud console, located at <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">console.cloud.google.com</a>. Once there you can navigate to the various pages you’ll need by clicking on links and menu items, but google offers a lot of different cloud services and it does take a little while for the interface to start feeling familiar, so I’ll link to the pages you need directly as well.</p>
<p>Before you can create a cluster of your very own, you need to create a project. Pretty much everything you do with google cloud services is organised into projects so that’s where we’ll start. To create a project, go to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate">console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate</a> and follow the prompts. Give your project a fancy name that makes you sound cool: I called mine <code>donut-art</code>.</p>
<p>Now that you have a project, you’ll need to enable the specific google cloud services that your project will need access to. In this example the only thing I’ll need is GKE itself, but in other situations you might need access to google cloud storage or something like that. To enable GKE on your current project go to <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/">console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/</a>. If it hasn’t already been enabled for the project the page will ask if you want to. Even more conveniently, if you don’t have a cluster running it will ask if you want to create one.<sup>14</sup> It will give you two options: an “autopilot” cluster is one where google will automatically manage the configuration for you, whereas for a “standard” cluster you’ll have to be more explicit about how many nodes you want and how they are organised. There are situations where you need to use the standard cluster,<sup>15</sup> but this is not one of those so I went with the autopilot approach because it’s simpler. I didn’t need to change any of the defaults: I called my cluster <code>donut-cluster</code>, and created it in the region <code>australia-southeast1</code>.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>Here’s a screenshot showing you what the relevant bit of the google kubernetes engine console looks like for me now that I have a cluster up and running:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-01-10_kubernetes/donut-cluster.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>If I click on the “donut-cluster” link it takes me to a page with a lot more detail, but you can see that some of the information is the same:</p>

<section id="command-line-tools" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="command-line-tools">Command line tools</h2>
<p>Time for a little digression.</p>
<p>Take a look at the menu shown in the last screenshot. If I click on the “connect” button and it will reveal a command I can use to connect to the cluster from the terminal on my laptop… but it requires me to have the gcloud command line tools installed. Now, if you don’t want to install the tools locally you can avoid this by selecting the “run in cloud shell” option that also appears on the dialog box. However, I dislike the cloud shell and prefer to work from my own terminal. So, the next step is to install the command line tools. For this project, the two things I need are gcloud (to interact with google cloud services) and kubectl (to interact with kubernetes).</p>
<section id="installing-gcloud" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-gcloud">Installing gcloud</h3>
<p>It turns out that installing the command line tools is relatively straightforward, and is made a lot easier thanks to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install">gcloud installation instructions</a> which are detailed and not too hard to follow. In addition to the basic tools, I installed the “gke-gcloud-auth-plugin” which are needed for authentication. Once the command line tools are installed, authentication from your terminal is a one-line command:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb10" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb10-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">gcloud</span> auth login</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>I can now interact with my google cloud projects from my command line.</p>
</section>
<section id="installing-kubectl" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-kubectl">Installing kubectl</h3>
<p>The second tool I need for this project is <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/">kubectl</a>, a command line tool used to control a kubernetes cluster. You can find installation instructions for different operating systems by visiting the kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">install tools</a> page. I’m doing this from a linux machine, so I also found it useful to enable autocompletion of kubectl commands within the bash shell. The instructions for this are included in the kubectl install page for linux.</p>
</section>
<section id="connect-to-the-cluster" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="connect-to-the-cluster">Connect to the cluster</h3>
<p>Now that I have gcloud and kubectl running, I can connect to my cluster. The first thing to do is use gcloud to get the credentials needed to connect to my cluster:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb11" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb11-1">  <span class="bu" style="color: null;">export</span> <span class="va" style="color: #111111;">USE_GKE_GCLOUD_AUTH_PLUGIN</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span>True</span>
<span id="cb11-2">  <span class="ex" style="color: null;">gcloud</span> container clusters get-credentials donut-cluster <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">--zone</span> australia-southeast1 <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">--project</span> donut-art</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<pre><code>Fetching cluster endpoint and auth data.
kubeconfig entry generated for donut-cluster.</code></pre>
<p>Then I can use kubectl to verify that it can connect to my cluster:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb13" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb13-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">kubectl</span> cluster-info</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<pre><code>Kubernetes control plane is running at blah blah blah
GLBCDefaultBackend is running at blah blah blah
KubeDNS is running at blah blah blah
KubeDNSUpstream is running at blah blah blah
Metrics-server is running at blah blah blah</code></pre>
<p>Okay, I may have edited the output slightly. The missing bits are the various URLs. They aren’t very interesting… the main thing to notice is that yes, kubectl can connect to my cluster and the cluster is up and running.</p>

<section id="kubernetes-terminology" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kubernetes-terminology">Kubernetes terminology</h2>
<p>Not surprisingly, kubernetes has a lot of terminology. That’s quite daunting when you’re getting started and I’m not going to attempt a complete glossary here. Instead, let’s start with these four terms, since we’ll use them a lot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Container</strong>. This has the same meaning it has in other contexts: a container is a self-contained executable that bundles up dependencies and runs isolated from other processes on the machine. Kubernetes supports other types of containers besides docker containers, but let’s pretend we’re only talking about docker here.</li>
<li><strong>Pod</strong>. A pod is the smallest deployable unit you can create: it is an abstraction that refers to one or more containers working together. An application can have many pods running on many machines (nodes) but each pod runs on one machine. Pods are considered ephemeral. Kubernetes will have no qualms about shutting down a pod if it doesn’t seem to be doing its job, or creating new pods to replace it if it needs to,<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Deployment</strong>. A deployment is an abstraction that specifies a collection of pods that your application runs. Essentially it describes your “desired state” for the application. When you “apply” a deployment kubernetes will start the application running (more or less), and try to make the thing that’s actually running look like your stated deployment configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Service</strong>. A service is an abstraction that specifies how the pods running on your kubernetes cluster communicate with the outside world. They’re awfully handy things to have if you want your application to be accessible on the web.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conceptually, it’s also helpful to know these terms at the very beginning, even though frankly I’m not going to do anything with them here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Node</strong>. A node refers one of the machines running in your cluster.</li>
<li><strong>Control Plane</strong>. The control plane refers to a collection of processes that run together on a single node and are in charge of actually running the whole thing. We won’t need to do anything to the control plane in this post other than leave it alone and let it do its job, but it does help to know the term because it shows up everywhere.</li>
</ul>
<p>More terms will appears as we go along – and I’ll try to explain all those when they pop up – but these are the ones that I wish I’d understood properly before I started trying to play with kubernetes clusters.</p>

<section id="create-a-deployment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-a-deployment">Create a deployment</h2>
<p>The way to configure your kubernetes cluster is with manifest files that are written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">yaml</a> format and use the <code>kubectl apply</code> command to update your cluster using the instructions laid out in the manifest file. You can use a manifest to modify any aspect to your cluster configuration, and later in this post I’ll show a few more manifests, but for now here’s the <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/donut/blob/main/deployment.yaml"><code>deployment.yaml</code></a> file I’m using to specify a deployment for the donuts application:</p>

</div>
<p>There’s a lot going on here, so for the moment let’s focus on the bottom.<sup>17</sup> The section of the code from lines 13-25 is used to specify the docker containers<sup>18</sup> that my cluster is going to deploy. There’s only one container listed in this section, and the line that reads <code>image: ghcr.io/djnavarro/donut:main</code> is the way that I’ve specified the docker image to use when creating the container. There are other settings I’ve used to set up this container: I’ve asked kubernetes to allocate memory and cpu resources to the container, and I’ve exposed container port 80 (which, if you can remember back that far, is where the plumber web API is running inside the container). I’ve also set <code>imagePullPolicy: Always</code> to ensure that every time I update this deployment kubernetes will pull the image from the registry afresh. I did that because more often than not while I was writing code for the kubernetes deployment I was tweaking the image too, and I wanted to make sure that I was always trying to deploy the most recent version of the image.</p>
<p>Okay, now that we know what’s going on in that section of the code, let’s collapse that part and think about the manifest file like this:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Okay, so now let’s think about the bottom part of this code too. Lines 9-13 of this condensed pseudo-manifest describe some kind of template. But a template for what? Well, as clearly stated on line 13 in human(ish) language, it’s a template for “one or more containers”. In kubernetes terminology, a deployable thing that holds one or more containers is a pod… so this section of the code is describing a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#pod-templates">pod template</a>. It’s an instruction to kubernetes that says… “hey, when you create a pod as part of this deployment, here’s the template you should use”. So we can simplify again:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>In this condensed form we can see that lines 5-10 provide a specification of the deployment itself. I’ve given it a pod template that tells kubernetes what the pods should look like, and I’ve specified the number of “replicas”. How many copies of this pod do I want it to run in this deployment: for no good reason at all I decided to run two (i.e., two replicas).</p>
<p>If we simplify the manifest yet again, we can see the top-level description:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">

</div>
</div>
<p>The only other things to point out right now is that the “kind” field is used to tell kubernetes what type of object to create (a Deployment), and the “apiVersion” field is used to specify which version of the kubernetes API to use when interpreting the manifest. That’s handy to note because later on I’ll be using APIs that are a bit more specific to the google kubernetes engine.</p>
<p>Okay, so now that we have some sense of what’s going on in the <code>deployment.yaml</code> file (ignoring the fact that I’ve glossed over the metadata bits), let’s actually apply it to our cluster:<sup>19</sup></p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb20" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb20-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">kubectl</span> apply <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-f</span> deployment.yaml</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>To see if it’s working we can use <code>kubectl get deployments</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb21" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb21-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">kubectl</span> get deployments</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<pre><code>NAME    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
donut   2/2     2            2           19h</code></pre>
<p>It is alive.</p>
<p>For more details on this part of the process, check out the kubernetes documentation on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/run-stateless-application-deployment/">deploying a stateless application</a>. You may also want to look at the page on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/">managing container resources</a> at this point.</p>

<section id="expose-the-deployment-no-https" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="expose-the-deployment-no-https">Expose the deployment (no https)</h2>
<p>At this point my little donut application is running happily on the cluster, but it doesn’t have a public IP address. No-one can visit it. To expose the deployment to the world you’ll need to start a service running that takes care of this for you. Exactly how you go about doing this depends on whether you want to enable https on the website. If you’re not too fussed about https the process is fairly simple and you can find details on how to do it by reading the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/stateless-application/expose-external-ip-address/">tutorial on exposing an external IP address</a>, and you may find the kubernetes <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">documentation on services</a> helpful too. The TL;DR is that it’s simple enough that you don’t even need to bother with a manifest file:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb23" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb23-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">kubectl</span> expose deployment donut <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">--type</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span>LoadBalancer <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">--name</span><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span>donut-service</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The application is now online. It has a public IP address that you can find, and if you own a domain that you want to map to that IP address all you have to do is create a DNS record that points the URL at the appropriate IP. With any luck your domain provider will have some decent documentation for this. For instance, I use google domains for <code>djnavarro.net</code> domain, and they have some pretty decent <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2579934?hl=en">instructions on configuring DNS records</a> that I could use to point <code>donut.djnavarro.net</code> at the IP address for my kubernetes application.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, I am a masochist, and as such I chose the option that delivers pain.</p>

<p>Configuring the kubernetes application to use https is a bit of a pain in the ass.<sup>20</sup> I’m deploying all this through google kubernetes engine, so the approach I took was to follow the guide for using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/managed-certs">google-managed ssl certificates</a>.

<p>The first thing you have to do is create a static IP address that you’ll later use for your cluster. The <code>gcloud compute addresses create</code> command does that for you. Here’s how I did that for my cluster:</p>

<p>When you do this, the output prints out the IP address and some other details. Later on, this is the address you’ll create a DNS record for so that – in my case – the <a href="https://donut.djnavarro.net/">https://donut.djnavarro.net/</a> address points to the correct location.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="get-a-certificate">Get a certificate</h3>
<p>The next step in the process is to create a managed certificate. Somebody needs to certify that my website is what it says it is.<sup>22</sup> I’m going to need a manifest file for this, which I’ve saved as <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/donut/blob/main/managed-cert.yaml"><code>managed-cert.yaml</code></a>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">

<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb26" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource yaml number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb26-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">apiVersion</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> networking.gke.io/v1</span></span>
<span id="cb26-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">kind</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> ManagedCertificate</span></span>
<span id="cb26-3"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">metadata</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span></span>
<span id="cb26-4"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">  </span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">name</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> managed-cert</span></span>
<span id="cb26-5"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">spec</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span></span>
<span id="cb26-6"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">  </span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">domains</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span></span>
<span id="cb26-7"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">    </span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">-</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> donut.djnavarro.net</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice that the <code>apiVersion</code> field here is using something specific to GKE: I’m using google infrastructure here and they’ve kindly<sup>23</sup> provided an API that makes it easy to use their managed certificates. The yaml here is pretty simple: I’m asking google to supply me with a certificate for my kubernetes application, which will be valid for the domain <code>donut.djnavarro.net</code> (you can list more than one here but I didn’t).</p>
<p>Now that I have a manifest, I apply it to my cluster in the usual way:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb27" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb27-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">kubectl</span> apply <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-f</span> managed-cert.yaml</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Okay, at this point in the guide it warns you that it might take an hour or so for the certificate to be provisioned. I manage so many websites now that I’d stopped paying attention to this warning because like, 90% of the time, the thing actually happens in 20 seconds. Yeah nah, not this time babe. This one actually took an hour. We’ll come back to it. I mean, if you want to check you can try this command:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb28" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb28-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">kubectl</span> describe managedcertificate managed-cert</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>It will print out a bunch of stuff, but when you scroll through the output you’ll very likely come across something that says that the certificate is “Provisioning”. It did work for me but it took a while so let’s move on while that is happening.</p>
</section>
<section id="create-a-service" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-a-service">Create a service</h3>
<p>Next up is the step that fucked me in the worst possible way. It failed, because I did a copy-paste on a bit of code that I needed to edit. I did that because the guide on the google website doesn’t flag this as something you need to edit. Worse yet, it failed silently because kubernetes had no bloody way to know my manifest was fucked up. Worst of all, for at least three hours I was convinced that my error was in the <em>later</em> step because this step failed silently.</p>
<p>Siiiiiiiiiiiiiigh. Computers were a mistake.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s start by looking at the manifest file, which I’ve called <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/donut/blob/main/mc-service.yaml"><code>mc-service.yaml</code></a>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">

</div>
</div>
<p>At this point in the process I freely admit I’m at the edge of my own knowledge, and I don’t want to say too much about something I only barely understand myself, but there are two things I will point out about this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Notice that under <code>spec.selector</code> (lines 5-7) I’m referring to the name of my deployment (<code>donut-example</code>). That’s what the kubernetes docs tell you to do when setting up a NodePort service (see <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">here</a>), but the guide on the the corresponding google page that I linked to earlier (i.e., <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/managed-certs">this one</a>) misled me. It made me think I was supposed to use the name of the service (<code>mc-service</code>). You want this service to point at your deployment!</p></li>
<li><p>Notice I’m doing everything on port 80? You probably don’t need to do this, but I found some discussion online about an old issue with kubernetes where they were hardcoding port 80 somewhere. I’m pretty certain that’s been properly resolved now and I don’t need to use port 80 for everything, but it was one of the tweaks I made on the way to figuring out the problem with <code>spec.selector</code> and… well… fuck it. The current version works and I’m new to kubernetes so I’m not changing it today.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, now that I have a manifest file I can apply it to the cluster:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb30" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb30-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">kubectl</span> apply <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-f</span> mc-service.yaml</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="create-the-dns-record" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-the-dns-record">Create the DNS record</h3>
<p>The next step in the process was to create a DNS record (with google domains in my case) for <code>donut.djnavarro.net</code> that points this subdomain to the appropriate IP address. I talked about this earlier in the post, so let’s move on…</p>
</section>
<section id="create-an-ingress" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="create-an-ingress">Create an ingress</h3>
<p>If the gods were kind we would be done, but of course we are not. I have a managed certificate and I have a service that exposes my deployment. That <em>doesn’t</em> mean that my application is configured to serve pages over https. To do this I need to create an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/">ingress</a> that manages external access to the service I created earlier and handles the SSL bit. Which is the thing I really need in order to make https work. Again…</p>
<p>Siiiiiiiiiiiigh.</p>
<p>Okay, here’s my <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/donut/blob/main/mc-ingress.yaml"><code>mc-ingress.yaml</code></a> manifest file for that:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>This manifest uses the static IP address I created (<code>donut-ip-address</code>), as well as the TLS certificate that I’ve asked google to provide me (<code>managed-cert</code>), and it specifies the <code>mc-service</code> I created as the backend. These things together give me https… apparently.</p>
<p>As usual, I apply the manifest to my cluster:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb32" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb32-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">kubectl</span> apply <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-f</span> mc-ingress.yaml </span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>I can inspect the results with <code>kubectl get ingress</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb33" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb33-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">kubectl</span> get ingress</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<pre><code>NAME         CLASS    HOSTS   ADDRESS         PORTS   AGE
mc-ingress   &lt;none&gt;   *       34.149.195.33   80      98s</code></pre>
<p>I might still have to wait for the certificate provisioning to finish, so I’d better check again:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb35" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb35-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">kubectl</span> describe managedcertificate managed-cert</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here’s the relevant bit of the output showing what it looks like once it’s all working:</p>
<pre><code>Spec:
  Domains:
    donut.djnavarro.net
Status:
  Certificate Name:    mcrt-b2204ff4-ad92-4811-a56d-f007190bb659
  Certificate Status:  Active
  Domain Status:
    Domain:     donut.djnavarro.net
    Status:     Active</code></pre>
<p>At last. I have https. It works, which I can verify simply by visiting <a href="https://donut.djnavarro.net">https://donut.djnavarro.net</a> and seeing if my app is working. Obviously I know that it is, because the embedded image at the start of the post is doing what it’s supposed to, but just for fun I’ll do it again:</p>
<a href="https://donut.djnavarro.net"><img width="100%" src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-01-10_kubernetes/https:/donut.djnavarro.net" title="donut.djnavarro.net"></a>
<p><br></p>
<p>Excellent. It works.</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="epilogue" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>The application I built is very limited, and I think it’s important to point to the things that I know it does poorly. I am sure there are others, but the big one is storage. As currently designed, the app generates a new image every time the site is visited. That’s wasteful, especially if you’re going to reuse images. You can do better than this by enabling google cloud storage, connecting to it as a volume, and writing generated images to storage when they are create. The plumber app would then check for the relevant files before trying to generate a new one. There’s a useful <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/volumes">tutorial on volumes</a> if you want to explore this with the google kubernetes engine.</p>
<p>It’s also worth pointing out that I have completely ignored <a href="https://helm.sh/">helm</a>, the package manager for kubernetes. Helm is excellent, and when the time comes that you want to deploy an application that someone else has designed properly, the thing you actually do is use a helm “chart”. For example, the one time I actually got <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">spark</a> running properly on a kubernetes cluster, the way I did it was using a terribly-useful helm chart provided by Bitnami: <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/spark/helm">bitnami.com/stack/spark/helm</a>. There’s a lot of useful tooling built up around kubernetes, and you might as well take advantage of that!</p>
<p>That being said… yes there’s a lot more to talk about, but I’m done with this post. I’m tired and unemployed, and since nobody is paying me for any of this I’m going to call it quits for today.</p>

For instance, the URL <a href="http://donut.djnavarro.net/?seed=6">http://donut.djnavarro.net/?seed=6</a> fixes the <code>seed</code> to 6, so the output will always be the same as the red and black donut shown in the bottom right of the output above.↩︎</p></li>

<li id="fn15"><p>An example would be if you plan to deploy <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">spark</a> on kubernetes.

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p>Docker docker docker baby. This is a post about docker, and on the off chance that you’ve been living under a rock for the last several years, docker<sup>1</sup> allows you to run your code within a “container” that isolates it from other processes running on your machine. Containers are a bit like virtual machines, but smaller, more portable, and don’t require you to have a complete copy of a second operating system running on your machine. They’re… actually, you know what? Why don’t I quote the relevant paragraphs from <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/">the docker website</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><strong>CONTAINERS</strong>: Containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel<sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup> <sup>4</sup> with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space. Containers take up less space than VMs (container images are typically tens of MBs in size), can handle more applications and require fewer VMs and Operating systems.</p>
<p><strong>VIRTUAL MACHINES</strong>: Virtual machines (VMs) are an abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many servers. The hypervisor allows multiple VMs to run on a single machine. Each VM includes a full copy of an operating system, the application, necessary binaries and libraries – taking up tens of GBs. VMs can also be slow to boot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They even have pretty pictures on the website. I thought about reproducing their figures for this blog post but why bother? If you want to look at their pictures you can go look at the website and in any case I think we can all agree that making these cute whale graphics with ggplot2 was a much better use of my time, yes?</p>

<p>Anyway. I’ve been meaning to teach myself docker for a few years now. It’s one of those “things” that has this weird aura of being difficult when it… doesn’t seem to be all that difficult? For a long time I’ve had this feeling of dread or insecurity about it, thinking that it must be “too technical” for me.<sup>5</sup> I have no doubt that the internals to docker are complicated, and there are subtleties to using docker well that will take a while to grasp, but when I managed to set aside my fears and read the documentation it turned out that the basics were surprisingly easy.</p>
<section id="installing-docker" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-docker">Installing docker</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">installation guides</a> on the docker website are good, and have information for various operating systems. I’m doing this on my ubuntu laptop<sup>6</sup> so I followed the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">ubuntu install guide</a>. I also went a little further and followed the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/">post-install instructions for linux</a> so that I could run docker commands without requiring superuser privileges: that’s the reason you won’t see any <code>sudo</code> commands in this post. Obviously, that’s something that will be a bit different on different operating systems and I’m not trying to write a tutorial here, but if you are using this post as a resource you can check that everything is working on your own installation by running this command:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">docker</span> run hello-world</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="column-page-right">
<pre><code>Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
2db29710123e: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:c77be1d3a47d0caf71a82dd893ee61ce01f32fc758031a6ec4cf1389248bb833

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Okay that looks good. Docker<sup>7</sup> seems to be running on my machine. As an aside, as long as you are online you don’t need to have a copy <code>hello-world</code> itself for this to work: docker will download it for you when you run the command.</p>
</section>
<section id="terminology" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>Before diving in and using docker, it helps to disambiguate three terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Container</strong>. A container is an executable. It runs on your machine isolated from other processes, has a namespace on the kernel, etc. Setting the particulars aside, it <em>is</em> a computing environment.</li>
<li><strong>Image</strong>. An image is a read-only template that contains the instruction to build a container. It’s a “snapshot” of a computing environment, constructed from one or more “layers” of build steps. Images are binaries that are stored locally and hosted on various registries. More on that later!</li>
<li><strong>Dockerfile</strong>. Finally, there’s the dockerfile.<sup>8</sup> That’s a plain text file that you as the user write. It contains the instructions for how to construct an image. They supply, in a (very!) abstract sense, the source code for an image.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it works like this. You use a dockerfile to <strong>build</strong> an image, the image contains the instructions to <strong>run</strong> a container, and the corresponding commands are quite sensibly called <code>docker build</code> and <code>docker run</code>. Or if you like diagrams with labelled arrows…</p>
<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%0A%5Cmbox%7Bdockerfile%7D%20%5Cxrightarrow%7B%5Cmbox%7Bbuild%7D%7D%20%5Cmbox%7Bimage%7D%20%5Cxrightarrow%7B%5Cmbox%7Brun%7D%7D%20%5Cmbox%7Bcontainer%7D%0A"></p>
<p>At any point you can get a summary of the images on your system by running <code>docker image list</code>. If you’re doing this with a fresh installation and you run the command after running the “hello world” example above,<sup>9</sup> you’d get output that looks like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">docker</span> image list</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<pre><code>REPOSITORY    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
hello-world   latest    feb5d9fea6a5   15 months ago   13.3kB</code></pre>
<p>You can do the same thing for containers with <code>docker container ls</code>,<sup>10</sup> which by default will show you currently-running containers. To see all containers, running or not, add the <code>--all</code> parameter:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">docker</span> container ls <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">--all</span></span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="column-page-right">
<pre><code>CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND    CREATED         STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES
efcf7186776f   hello-world   "/hello"   6 minutes ago   Exited (0) 6 minutes ago             bold_davinci</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Notice the difference in the “CREATED” time! The <em>image</em> for hello-world is something that someone else created 15 months ago and kindly placed online so I could pull it onto my machine without building it myself. The <em>container</em> is the executable that I created from that image a mere 6 minutes ago when I called <code>docker run</code>. They’re both currently on my laptop, but they are quite different things.</p>
<p>Ah, but I am rambling again, aren’t I? Sorry. Shall we have a go at this then?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="motivating-problem">Motivating problem</h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-12-31_btw-i-use-arch/">last post</a> I mentioned that, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch">btw I use arch</a> now.<sup>11</sup> Well. Sort of. A more accurate statement would be to say that I installed arch linux on a secondary laptop as something to play with and I’m still using ubuntu for my day to day coding. At the moment I’m still getting used to the quirks of arch and encountering odd behaviour when – for example – one of my scripts that ran perfectly well on my ubuntu machine caused RStudio to crash when I ran it on the arch box. The “it works on my machine” problem strikes again… sigh.</p>
<p>In an effort to isolate the problem I started reran the unit tests for the package that I thought might be responsible for the crash and they all passed on both machines, but since that package is my <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-12-22_queue/">queue</a> package and the unit test aren’t as comprehensive as I’d like I would not be at all surprised if there’s an exotic bug that makes it fail only on arch.</p>
<p>All this made me think a little about how I typically use CI.<sup>12</sup> Like many R developers I’ll use github actions to run my unit tests on mac os, ubuntu, and windows. I’ll run the tests with multiple versions of R including R-devel. If I’m thinking about a CRAN submission I’ll expand the scope and run my tests using other services also.</p>
<p>I’ve never tested on arch though.</p>
<p>I’ve never tested on arch because I’ve never had an arch machine to test on before. Or… [docker enters from stage left]… I’ve never had an arch image that I can use to containerise my unit tests before…</p>
<p>Ooh… a side project! Why don’t I try creating some docker images with R running on arch linux? In other words, why don’t I do a really lazy, half-arsed version of the thing that the <a href="https://rocker-project.org/">rocker project</a> has already done to an extremely high standard with ubuntu and debian… except with arch?<sup>13</sup></p>

It’s not as cool as the scintillating grid version, but I used to teach it in introductory cognitive science classes and I have a soft spot for it.</figcaption><p></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="minimal-example">Minimal example</h2>
<p>Sometimes the easiest way to tell a story is to begin at the ending, and – spoiler! – I did in fact succeed in my attempt,<sup>14</sup> and I am now the proud<sup>15</sup> maintainer of two hastily-constructed images hosted on the github container repository. Now that I have these things, it should be really easy for us to put together a simple project that will run R code using these images and – even though I’m going to be using my ubuntu laptop – have it be executed by a container that is running arch.</p>
<p>Oh. The. Thrill.</p>
<p>Be. Still. My. Beating. Heart.</p>
<p>Okay, so here it is. Accompanying this post is a project called <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/quarto-blog/tree/main/posts/2023-01-01_playing-with-docker/system-check"><code>system-check</code></a> that consists of a three-line dockerfile and a two-line R script. Let’s ignore the dockerfile for a moment and focus on the R code. Here’s the script:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>./system-check/script.R</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">cat</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">c</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"Running on:"</span>, osVersion), <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">sep =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">\n</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">  "</span>)</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">cat</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">c</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"With locale:"</span>, <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">strsplit</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">Sys.getlocale</span>(), <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">";"</span>)[[<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span>]]), <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">sep =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">\n</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">  "</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>If we ignore the parts the code dedicated to making the output pretty, we can see that all it’s doing is printing the <code>osVersion</code> and calling <code>Sys.getlocale()</code>. Here’s what happens when I run the script on my ubuntu laptop, without using docker in any way:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">Rscript</span> ./system-check/script.R</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<pre><code>Running on:
  Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
With locale:
  LC_CTYPE=en_AU.UTF-8
  LC_NUMERIC=C
  LC_TIME=en_AU.UTF-8
  LC_COLLATE=en_AU.UTF-8
  LC_MONETARY=en_AU.UTF-8
  LC_MESSAGES=en_AU.UTF-8
  LC_PAPER=en_AU.UTF-8
  LC_NAME=C
  LC_ADDRESS=C
  LC_TELEPHONE=C
  LC_MEASUREMENT=en_AU.UTF-8
  LC_IDENTIFICATION=C</code></pre>
<p>The first part of the output tells me my operating system (ubuntu), and the second part specifies the locale. I’m in Australia so for most things my locale is <code>en_AU.UTF-8</code>. That makes sense, but of course this output is specific to my machine: an arch user running R in the United States should expect to see something very different.</p>
<p>That’s where docker comes in.</p>
<p>The docker images that I built and am hosting on github simulate exactly that. The computing environments specified by the <code>arch-r-base</code> and <code>arch-r-test</code> images use arch linux as the operating system and have the system locale set to <code>en_US.UTF-8</code>. So if I were to execute this script from within a container running the <code>arch-r-base</code><sup>16</sup> image, I should expect to see different results even though my laptop is running ubuntu and my system locale is <code>en_AU.UTF-8</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s a dockerfile specifying an image that does exactly that:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>./system-check/Dockerfile</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb10" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode dockerfile code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode dockerfile"><span id="cb10-1"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">FROM</span> ghcr.io/djnavarro/arch-r-base:release</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">COPY</span> script.R /home/script.R</span>
<span id="cb10-3"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">CMD</span> <span class="ex" style="color: null;">Rscript</span> /home/script.R</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It’s a sequence of three <strong>docker instructions</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Like all dockerfiles, it begins with a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from"><code>FROM</code></a><sup>17</sup> <sup>18</sup> instruction that specifies the name of a preexisting docker image to use as a starting point. I’ve been very explicit here and <a href="https://windsock.io/referencing-docker-images/">referenced the image</a> using a fully qualified name that consists of a container repository (<code>ghcr.io</code>), a username (<code>djnavarro</code>), the image name <code>arch-r-base</code>, and an optional tag (<code>release</code>). You don’t always need to be that precise, especially if you’re using an image that you know exists locally.</p></li>
<li><p>The second step is a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy"><code>COPY</code></a> instruction that copies the R script to a specific file path within the image. This takes place at build time. This step is necessary because when the container starts up it will be isolated from other processes on the system. It doesn’t have access to the host file system. If you want the container to have access to a file you need to copy it at build time.<sup>19</sup></p></li>
<li><p>The third step is a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd"><code>CMD</code></a> instruction. Every dockerfile must have a <code>CMD</code> instruction (and much like highlanders there can be only one) specifying a default for what the container should do when it is launched.<sup>20</sup></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Later on, when you’re starting to feel comfortable with the basic idea of writing dockerfiles, its worth reading the official guide on <a href="https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/">dockerfile best practices</a>. Lots of little things started to make sense to me when I did that. For now, let’s just acknowledged that yes Virginia we have a dockerfile.</p>

<section id="building-the-image" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-the-image">Building the image</h3>
<p>Our next step is to build it to an image. The way we do that from the terminal is with the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/"><code>docker build</code></a> command. For the purposes of this post – which I am writing in quarto and thus has a code execution engine blah blah blah – I am going to assume<sup>21</sup> that the working directory is set to the folder containing the post, and that it contains a subfolder called <code>system-check</code> in which the dockerfile and the R script are stored. In other words, <code>system-check</code> is the directory holding the docker project.</p>
<p>The simplest way to build an image from this project is like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb11" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb11-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">docker</span> build system-check</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This command tells docker to look for a dockerfile in the <code>system-check</code> folder, and make an image using whatever it finds there. That’s a perfectly fine way to do it, but my personal preference is to give the resulting image a name, using the <code>--tag</code> flag. So the command, which I’ve broken over a few lines to highlight its structure, now looks like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb12" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb12-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">docker</span> build <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2">  <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">--tag</span> my-system-check <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb12-3">  system-check</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The reason I’ve done this is that later on when I call the <code>docker run</code> command I can refer to the image by name, which does make life simpler. Under normal circumstances I’d probably have called the image <code>system-check</code> rather than <code>my-system-check</code> (why create new names when I don’t need to?) but for the purposes of this post I think it’s helpful to be clear that when I refer to the image name I’m referring to the thing I created using <code>--tag</code>, not the name of the folder that holds the dockerfile!</p>
<p>Okay, enough talk. Let’s run it this time:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb13" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb13-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">docker</span> build <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;">\</span></span>

<p>The output here shows you that the build process unfolds as a sequence of three steps: one for each of our docker instructions. It also gives you the impression (correctly!) that the first step is considerably more complex than the other two. That makes sense: the <code>arch-r-base</code> image is itself constructed from a sequence of steps, and those steps have produced an image that is built from several “layers”. Each of those hexadecimal hashes refers to one of the layers.<sup>22</sup></p>
<p>When you run this on your own system you’ll see little progress bars as the different layers of the image are downloaded. For example, that line that says <code>597018910566: Pull complete</code>? That’s referring to the very first layer in the <code>arch-r-base</code> image (which is arch linux itself) and that layer is about 280MB or something like that, so you get a little progress bar to let you know how its going. That’s super helpful if you ever find yourself using the <code>arch-r-test</code> image, because one of the layers in that image includes a texlive installation (ugh) so that layer is (I’m so sorry) about 2GB in size.</p>
<p>Downloading large images is a huge pain, and generally I would try to avoid creating an image with a layer that large. Thankfully, docker is smart enough to check the local cache before trying to download anything.<sup>23</sup> We can see this in action if we repeat the exact same command:</p>

<p>This finishes instantaneously because docker<sup>24</sup> <sup>25</sup> notices that I already have a copy of this image so it uses the cache for everything.</p>

</div>
<p>Now, you might be wondering about those image sizes. Did I really just create <em>two</em> 955MB images? That seems a bit much. It’s certainly true that the image is 955MB in size: after all, the image does have to describe an entire operating system running R, so it’s not surprising that it isn’t tiny. But it looks as if I just wasted an entire GB of space by making two of them. Thankfully, docker is not that silly. The <code>my-system-check</code> image is almost identical to <code>arch-r-base</code>. In fact, it’s just one very small layer added on top of the layers that comprise the <code>arch-r-base</code> image. If you dig into the documentation on <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/">storage</a> you discover that docker quite sensibly allows images to share layers, so even though <code>arch-r-base</code> and <code>my-system-check</code> are individually 955MB in size, they are also <em>collectively</em> 955MB in size thanks to layer sharing.</p>
<p>The sheer excitement of working with computers is just too much for me to bear sometimes.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="run-in-a-container">Run in a container</h3>
<p>Okay, we are ready to go baby! The image is set up, and all we have to do is run it in a container using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/"><code>docker run</code></a>. The <code>docker run</code> command is quite powerful, and has a lot of arguments you can use to control how the image executes.<sup>26</sup> I’m not going to use any of that flexibility here. This is just a vanilla command asking docker to run the <code>my-system-check</code> image:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fancier-example">Fancier example</h2>
<p>For the next example I’ll add a little bit of extra complexity. The real reason I wanted the <code>arch-r</code> images in the first place was to make it easier to run unit tests for an R package on a system running arch linux. If I were going to do this properly I’d set it up in a way that could be incorporated into a CI workflow with github actions, but I’m not going to be that fancy for this blog post. Instead, I’ll set it up so that I can generate containers running arch linux that can clone a package repository from github into the container, and then run the unit tests. I’ll even give it a bit of flexibility so that the user can decide at build time<sup>28</sup> which github repository the container points to.</p>
<p>As before the project – which I’ve called <code>test-on-arch</code> – consists of two files. There’s an R script that executes at run time, and the dockerfile executed at build time. Here they are:</p>

<p>Like last time, the place to start is with the R script. It expects to find <code>user</code>, <code>repo</code>, and <code>cran</code> values as environment variables. Once it finds those, it clones the <code>user/repo</code> repository from github, installs any dependencies of the package from <code>cran</code>, and then uses rcmdcheck to check the downloaded package.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at how the dockerfile sets up the computing environment to enable this script to be run on arch linux:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Just like we saw in the last example, the dockerfile begins with a <code>FROM</code> instruction. This time around though I’m using the <code>arch-r-test</code> image rather than the <code>arch-r-base</code> image. Much like the base image, the test image runs arch linux and installs R in the environment. However, it also installs several other system dependencies and R packages that come in handy when running <code>R CMD check</code>, which makes it a bit more useful in this context.</p></li>
<li><p>The next step in the dockerfile is the <code>COPY</code> instruction that ensures that the image has a copy of the R script. There’s nothing new here so we can move on.</p></li>
<li><p>The next two steps use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg"><code>ARG</code></a> instruction. This is a new one for us: it’s a mechanism for allowing the user to specify arguments that will be passed to docker when building the image. That’s handy because it means I can customise the image that gets built. The obvious use here is that I can specify the <code>user</code> and the <code>repo</code> for the package that I want to check! (Later on we’ll see how this is done using the <code>--build-arg</code> argument to <code>docker build</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Next up is another <code>ARG</code> step, used to specify the url for the <code>cran</code> repository that the container should use to download any R packages. Notice, however, that this time I’ve specified a default value, so you don’t actually have to specify <code>cran</code> when you call <code>docker build</code>: if you don’t it will just use the default url</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>ARG</code> steps pass the user input to docker, but they don’t set any environment variables (remember, our R script is expecting to find environment variables). That’s the job of the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env"><code>ENV</code></a> instructions that appear in the next three steps.<sup>29</sup></p></li>
<li><p>Finally, we have the <code>CMD</code> instruction, which specifies a default action for the container: run the script.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-the-image-1">Building the image</h3>
<p>Setting aside the fact that our <code>test-on-arch</code> project has a lot of flaws and limitations, it will serve the purposes we need it to. Let’s say I want to create an image that will check the queue package hosted at <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/queue/">github.com/djnavarro/queue</a>. To do that I’ll need to set <code>user=djnavarro</code> and <code>repo=queue</code> when I build the image, which I can do with the <code>--build-arg</code> argument:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb23" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb23-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">docker</span> build <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb23-2">  <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">--tag</span> test-queue <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;">\</span></span>

<span id="cb23-4">  <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">--build-arg</span> repo=queue <span class="dt" style="color: #AD0000;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb23-5">  test-on-arch</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Notice that I’ve chosen to call this image <code>test-queue</code>. A nice thing about being able to name the images independently from the dockerfile is that it’s easy to create multiple images using the same dockerfile (just with different arguments) and give them meaningful names. And sure, this particular example is very silly because literally everything I’m doing here at the build stage could be done just as efficiently at the run stage. But whatever.</p>
<p>Let’s see what happens when I try to execute this build command. The <code>arch-r-test</code> image is considerably larger than <code>arch-r-base</code>. This one isn’t a frugal image! It takes a while, so I’m going to go have a smoke while I wait<sup>30</sup> but the nice thing is that if you’ve done it once you don’t have to do it again. Anyway…</p>

<p>Notice that during the first step when downloading <code>arch-r-test</code>, I didn’t have to download the whole thing. Two of the layers in <code>arch-r-test</code> are shared with the <code>arch-r-base</code> image, and docker is smart enough to notice that I already have those layers in my cache. That’s what the <code>Already exists</code> part of the output indicates. Admittedly it doesn’t save us much in this case because its the texlive installation that causes pain, but it’s a nice feature nevertheless.</p>
<p>As a little sanity check – because, dear reader, I have been sitting here waiting very patiently while a large image downloaded over a slow connection and would like to confirm that I don’t have to do that again – let’s repeat the exercise from earlier and try building it a second time just to reassure ourselves that the cache is doing its job:</p>

<p>Not going to lie, I breathed a little sigh of relief. Docker used the cached layers, and that all happened instantaneously. Okay cool. I’m going to stop doing these checks from now on, but one last time let’s take a peek at the list of images I have stored locally:</p>

<p>Okay yes, this is the expected result. That note would of course get me in trouble on CRAN, but it’s what I was expecting to see: I get the same note on ubuntu. I just haven’t gotten around to fixing it yet. The only part that is different to what I see on ubuntu is this:</p>

<p>Yeah. This is interesting. I deliberately didn’t try to faff about with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd">systemd</a> in these images, so this is an expected warning. It’s not a problem with queue or with arch, just a consequence of how I built the images. That would have some consequences for testing a lot of packages, but I’m not trying to recreate the rocker project here so I’m not too fussed about it in this little exercise.</p>

<p>The advantage to passing arguments is that you can build many images from the same dockerfile, and docker will reuse the cached layers intelligently. We’ve seen this already, but here’s another example. Let’s try using the <code>test-on-arch</code> dockerfile to build an image that checks the <a href="https://github.com/rladies/praise">praise</a> package. Up to this point I’ve never tried testing the praise package on arch before, but (of course????) this builds immediately and without downloading anything, because everything that actually matters about this build was already done when I built the <code>test-queue</code> image earlier:</p>

<p>Again note the value of layer sharing. If these were all independent images we’d be looking at 17GB on disk. In fact, because <code>arch-r-test</code> reuses the layers from <code>arch-r-base</code> and all the other images are trivial additions to one of these two images, the <em>total</em> size of all these images is in fact “only” 5GB… i.e., the size of the <code>arch-r-test</code> image. And again, the only reason that one is so big is that I was really fussy about tex installations and bundled an entire texlive distribution with extra fonts and everything because I have no desire deal with tests whining about missing tex stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s get back on track and run the <code>test-praise</code> image in a container:</p>

<p>Once again we see the warning about systemd, and once again I am ignoring it. The thing that matters here, as far as I’m concerned, is that the unit tests for the praise package pass on arch.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-small-caution">A small caution</h3>
<p>Before we move onto the third project I want to talk about one more example using this one, as a way of cautioning anyone who might feel inclined to use it without fixing its many deficiencies. Let’s try using <code>test-on-arch</code> to run the unit tests for ggplot2, shall we? Unlike praise and queue, ggplot2 is a large and complicated package with substantial dependencies and a lot of unit tests. That’s going to be a problem given that <code>test-on-arch</code> clones the entire repository from scratch every time it’s called. Building the image is easy, because the build stage for <code>test-on-arch</code> doesn’t do anything except copy the script and pass a few arguments…</p>

<span id="cb39-5">  test-on-arch </span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>But when we call <code>docker run</code> things become unpleasant for us even before we’ve had a chance to start running the unit tests, because the git clone operation is very time consuming…</p>

<pre><code>Transferred 15676 of 74694 objects...</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>…uh, right. Look this is going to take a while, so maybe we should move on?</p>
<p>The main reason I wanted to point to this is to highlight that the clone step occurs at run time, and the entire clone operation is repeated every time we call it. That’s not a smart way to do this. If you really wanted to design a docker workflow for testing packages on arch, you’d want to make some smarter design choices than this! The <code>test-on-arch</code> project I’ve used in this blog post is a toy, nothing more.<sup>31</sup></p>

<p>For the third example, let’s look at the <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/arch-r/blob/main/base/Dockerfile"><code>arch-r-base</code></a> image itself. In addition to the dockerfile there are two small text files used to specify locale information. The two locale files aren’t very interesting and could easily have been included as strings in the dockerfile, but I found it neater to keep them separate. The <code>locale-gen</code> file specifies locales that the image understands, and <code>locale.conf</code> specifies configuration details. (Both are configuration files on linux). In any case, here’s the whole thing:</p>

<p>Truly exciting stuff, I know. Thankfully only some of it is new. The <code>FROM</code> instruction uses the <code>archlinux:base-devel</code> image hosted <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/archlinux">here</a>. The <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run"><code>RUN</code></a> instruction is used to execute commands at build time, so you can see in this example I’ve used it to create system locale information (by calling <code>locale-gen</code>) and to install R (using the <code>pacman</code> package manager used on arch linux).</p>
<p>The other new thing here is the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#label"><code>LABEL</code></a> instruction used to supply metadata about the image. This is particularly important if you’re planning to make your image public, as I have done with the <code>arch-r-base</code> and <code>arch-r-test</code> images. The labelling that I’ve supplied here follows the <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/annotations.md">specifications</a> provided by the <a href="https://opencontainers.org/">open container initiative</a>, or at least attempts to. I’m still new to this, but as far as I can tell this is correct? Anyway, you can see that it specifies the location of the source code, the author of the image, and the licence. That’s the main thing.</p>
<p>You are probably wondering, though, why the description just reads “DESCRIPTION” and doesn’t have an actual… you know… description. The reason for that is that I’m hosting these through the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry">github container registry</a> that links my github repository to the images automatically. Specifically, I’m using a github action that automates the build process and populates the description on the <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/arch-r/pkgs/container/arch-r-base">arch-r-base package page</a> using the description field from the <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/arch-r">arch-r github repository</a>. Leaving the value for that field as “DESCRIPTION” ensures that all works smoothly.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I’m not in any way an expert on github actions – this is my first attempt at creating a workflow and I cribbed heavily from other workflows I found online – but for whatever it’s worth I figure I should share. Here’s the <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/arch-r/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-image.yaml">workflow</a> I’m using:</p>

<p>For this workflow to run, I needed to edit the permissions associated with my github PAT to include some additional scopes. If, like me, you’ve created your PAT using the default scopes provided by <code>usethis::create_github_token()</code>, you’ll need a few more to run workflows that build and modify docker images if you want to work with github packages. This workflow doesn’t use all these, but the permissions typically required for to work with container images on github are these:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>read:packages</code> scope to download container images and read metadata.</li>
<li><code>write:packages</code> scope to download and upload container images and read and write metadata.</li>
<li><code>delete:packages</code> scope to delete container images.</li>
</ul>
<p>In any case, this github actions workflow triggers an automatic deployment to the github container registry whenever there is a new push to the release branch of the repository. This is what creates the <code>ghcr.io/djnavarro/arch-r-base:release</code> and <code>ghcr.io/djnavarro/arch-r-test:release</code> images. I’m entirely certain that this could be done in a more sophisticated way, but it does work, and that was my main goal for this post.</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Look, I know it’s technically supposed to be “Docker” not “docker” and it’s supposed to be “GitHub” not “github”. But my body was “supposed” to use testosterone as its primary sex hormone too, and we’ve all seen how little regard I had for that. Sometimes conventions are worth breaking out of sheer bloody-mindedness.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>STEM people need to find new words for things. What is a “kernel”? Is it the bits of an operating system that run essential processes? Is it a specialised function that applies only to input arguments of specific types (i.e., what R folks would call a “method” in the functional object oriented programming sense, as opposed to the encapsulated object-oriented programming paradigm that dominates in other languages)? Or is it the thing the governs the transformation from data space to feature space in a support vector machine or other inferential systems built on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces? For fuck’s sake people LEARN A NEW WORD.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>I’d like to propose using “egg” in lieu of “kernel” for any new tech nomenclature. Not only does it show you have some wit and know your audience.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Your audience consists of queers. Nobody else reads this far into a nested footnote series.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Sometimes I think that the “not technical enough” concept is just straight up misogyny, both internalised and… external. I mean, I taught myself Bayesian nonparametrics and algorithmic information theory and even wrote respected academic papers in both those fields in addition to my own discipline of mathematical psychology. I was an editor at Science (yes, the journal). I wrote a quite successful statistics textbook. I’m an author on the ggplot2 book. I was a successful tenured academic in a mathematical science with no formal training in mathematics. I’ve taught myself several programming languages. Last year I wrote quite a lot of Apache Arrow content that everyone seems to like. So, um, yeah. Perhaps I should stop paying attention to the opinions of boys who condescend to me and tell me I’m not technical enough because… I’m stronger in R than in Python or C++? Tiresome.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Yes I know <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-12-31_btw-i-use-arch/">I use Arch now</a>, hush. you’ll see why I’m doing this from ubuntu in a moment…↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>I suppose, for the sake of precision, I should draw attention to the part of the output that refers to the <strong>docker client</strong> and the <strong>docker daemon</strong>. Docker takes a client-server approach. When I’m typing these commands I’m interacting with the docker client, which passes my requests over to the docker daemon. The daemon is the process that does most of the work. It pulls images from registries (e.g., <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">docker hub</a>, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry">github container registry</a>, etc), it builds images, it creates containers, etc. In this case, the client and the daemon are both running on the same machine, but they don’t actually have to. The daemon could totally run on a remote system. However, the distinction between the client and the daemon isn’t important for this post so I’m going to ignore it and collectively refer to both of them working together as “docker”.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>I’m sure that’s supposed to be “Docker file”. Per my earlier footnote, I don’t care.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>As a little aside. In order to create this output with the “appearance” of starting with a fresh docker installation I – quite nobly – cleared out all my cached containers and images so that I could start from a clean system. Should you ever want to do the same, it’s a two step process. Assuming you don’t have any containers running, your first step is to delete any containers on your system that aren’t running (i.e., all of them) with <code>docker container prune</code>. Then you can delete any “dangling” images that aren’t associated with a container (i.e., all of them) with <code>docker image prune --all</code>. You’re welcome.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>No I don’t know why they use <code>list</code> for images and <code>ls</code> for containers. That seems unhelpful.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>I strongly feel there is qualitative dissertation to be written mapping the btw-i-use-arch guy onto the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_Explain_Things_to_Me">men-explain-things-to-me</a> guy from the Rebecca Solnit essay. As far as I can tell they are essentially the same person, just inhabiting different semantic domains. One day I will write the story of the guy at a conference who breathlessly explained a paper to me and how my work would be improved considerably if I’d read it while I was quietly wondering how to explain to him that it was my paper… sigh. <em>Men</em>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>Am I the only one who still thinks that CI should stand for “confidential informant” rather than “continuous integration”?↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>Quite obviously, I do not actually recommend anyone use the images I’ve set up. I mean, surely my phrasing here makes 1000% clear that this is a cute project I threw together in a couple of days for my own amusement. If you are looking to do reproducible computing in R you should be using the images provided by rocker. If you use my images and something goes wrong then to be perfectly frank you only have yourself to blame.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>Set your sights low enough and it is very easy to achieve your goals.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>No.&nbsp;Just no.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>It’s an open question how long I’m going to last in this post before making an Archer joke.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>Technically it’s possible for an <code>ARG</code> instruction to precede a <code>FROM</code> instruction but I’m yet to actually see that in the wild.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>Much like SQL clauses, docker instructions are written in uppercase by convention. They don’t actually <em>have</em> to be uppercase, but again, I’ve never seen a dockerfile written any other way. Along the same lines, your dockerfile doesn’t actually have to be called “Dockerfile”, but it’s the default and everyone uses it.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>Alternatively, you can use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#volume"><code>VOLUME</code></a> instruction to create a mount point and use that as a way to share a folder between the host and the container at run time, but that’s more fiddly and there’s really no need for that in this simple example. But if you want an easy-to-follow example using the <code>VOLUME</code> instruction in an R project, Colin Fay uses it in his <a href="https://colinfay.me/docker-r-reproducibility/">docker for R users</a> post.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>The user can override the default by when calling <code>docker run</code> but I’m not going to cover that in this post↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>Correctly.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>To a first approximation you can imagine that every docker instruction produces a layer, and it is my understanding that this is how it used to be. But for efficiency reasons more recent versions of docker only produce persistent layers from <code>RUN</code>, <code>COPY</code>, and <code>ADD</code> instructions. Other instructions produce temporary intermediate images, but do not create persistent layers in the final image.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>Or, as Sterling would phrase it, “I swear I had something for this.”↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>Now that I’ve started making Archer jokes, it’s very hard not to turn “docker” into a euphemism. Hm. I should call him.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>Look all I’m saying is that “Queering the dock: images as tops, containers as bottoms” would make a terrible thesis and I would read the hell out of it.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn26"><p>In truth I didn’t actually need to construct the <code>my-system-check</code> image at all: I could have just run <code>arch-r-base</code> in a container with a few arguments tweaked. But that would defeat the point of the exposition, obviously.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>Phrasing.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>Okay yeah I could do this at run time too, but I want an excuse to talk about the <code>ARG</code> instruction.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>Okay yes, clever person, I could have chosen to pass environment variables at run time using the <code>--env</code> argument to <code>docker run</code>. I didn’t need to do this at build time using <code>ARG</code>. But that would defeat the point of the exposition wouldn’t it? I wanted to use <code>ARG</code> and <code>ENV</code> in the main text, and quietly mention the <code>--env</code> argument to <code>docker run</code> in an aside. And I have now accomplished exactly that, haven’t I?↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>I am, after all, “on smoko” (which in my case means I am unemployed and bored out of my mind) but incidentally if you want to see the most fabulous cover ever (Wet Leg covering The Chats), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_dza9y6cg0">here it is</a>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>I know the mystery will be too much for some people so I’d better resolve it: no, the ggplot2 tests didn’t pass on the arch image. Some of the dependencies didn’t install properly, and then eventually it threw an error trying to build the vignettes. If I had the energy I’d dig into it and figure out why… but I don’t.↩︎</p></li>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p>I installed <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> on an aging Dell XPS 13 today.</p>
<p>Did I plan to do this when I woke up this morning? No, it was an impulsive decision. Was it a sensible way to spend the last Friday of 2022? Also no. Was it the kind of thing that will pay off in the long run through a deeper technical understanding of… something? Again, the answer is no.</p>
<p>Ah, but will it impress people and make them think I am cool?</p>
<p>Oh honey.</p>
<p>No.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>But look…</p>

<section id="installing-arch" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="installing-arch">Installing Arch</h2>
<p>I have absolutely no intention of writing a “how to install Arch” guide, for many excellent reasons. Top of that list is that I am a complete amateur when it comes to Arch and I have no idea whatsoever what I’m doing. The only reason any of this happened is that I happened to have a spare laptop<sup>2</sup> and couldn’t think of anything better to do with it. My point is I have no business whatsoever in trying to guide anyone else through the installation process. What I am going to do, however, is jot down my notes to myself on the process. I may need them again…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The installation guide (<a href="wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide">https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide</a>) is good but dense, and I had to read a lot of the documents it links to in order to make progress. It took me three tries to get a working installation, because I missed some subtle thing (e.g., the first time I didn’t have the bootable USB booting in UEFI mode, because <em>obviously</em> I would have thought of that at the beginning… sigh).</p></li>
<li><p>Everything became easier once I started feeling comfortable using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/pacman">pacman</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The network configuration step gave me some grief. Eventually I got it to work when I installed <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager">NetworkManager</a> and enabled <code>NetworkManager.service</code>, which in turn only made sense to me after I’d read about <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Reading#Control_of_systemd_units">start/enable</a> and realised that “starting” a service sets it running in the background now, and “enabling” it means it will start automatically on startup.</p></li>
<li><p>Toward the end of the installation it tells you to install a bootloader. I thought I wouldn’t need to since I already had grub on my machine from the previous Ubuntu install but in the end it didn’t work without going through the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB">GRUB</a> install process</p></li>
<li><p>Setting up users was an odd exercise in reminding me that I’d forgotten what life was like before sudo. During the initial installation I set up a root user, but no regular users, so my first step was to give myself a … um, me. This article on <a href="https://linuxhint.com/add_users_arch_linux/">adding users on Arch Linux</a> was helpful. Partly because it’s a nice walkthrough, but also because it clued me into the fact that Arch doesn’t come with <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/sudo">sudo</a>, so I had to install that. It also highlighted things I’d never thought about with sudo before, mostly around which users have sudo privileges. Anyway, the article walked me through the process so now I am danielle on my Arch box (insert the usual Australian joke about getting a root). I added myself to the wheel group so that I can escalate to admin privileges using sudo, and I’m done.</p></li>
<li><p>As much as the thought of returning to my childhood and running a computer without any desktop environment at all amused me… no. No we are going to have a desktop. I did think about other possible desktop environments besides old faithful, but in the end decided that I actually quite like the look and feel of default <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME">GNOME</a> (even without the various tweaks that distros usually overlay on top of it) so I installed that. I did, however, make one concession to nostalgia. I decided not to have the machine automatically boot into GNOME. Instead I followed the instructions so I could start it with <code>startx</code> as soon as I log in, or choose to stay in the shell.</p></li>
<li><p>Installing a decent browser (<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/firefox">firefox</a>, obviously…) was easy, but not surprisingly the font situation for the web was a bit tricky. Arch doesn’t come with an extensive font library so the browser would often rely on fallback fonts for pages that don’t bundle the fonts, making a lot of pages look a bit unpleasant. Fixing that took a bit of digging. The best description on fonts I found was <a href="https://gist.github.com/YoEight/d19112db56cd8f93835bf2d009d617f7">this gist</a>. I have a suspicion that it’s the <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/noto-fonts/">noto-fonts</a> package that does a lot of the work in fixing the issues</p></li>
<li><p>Fixing the touchpad scroll direction and speed was awkward too. Initially the settings panel in GNOME didn’t acknowledge that I even had a touchpad, which was annoying. So I started trying to edit the <a href="https://man.archlinux.org/man/xorg.conf.5">xorg.conf</a> settings and… actually I don’t think that fixed anything but weirdly after editing <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> the touchpad settings magically showed up in the GNOME settings panel and then I could edit them. Yeah. I have no idea whatsoever whether this had anything to do with me, or if the gods at large were messing with me or what. So um… yeah, future Danielle, best of luck!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on…</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="setting-up-r-on-arch" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-up-r-on-arch">Setting up R on Arch</h2>
<p>Any time I get a new machine set up, my first discretionary task is to make sure that I can do data science work with it (that’s a depressingly revealing statement about me). Once upon a time that really meant getting R set up, but I’m a bit more polyglot nowadays (gasp!). Nevertheless, R is my first love so I always start there…</p>
<p>Some of the set up tasks are easy, or at least as easy as anything gets on linux. For example, installing <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/r">R</a> is “easy”, and installing <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/git">git</a> is “easy”. Similarly, if you use <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Visual_Studio_Code">VS code</a> as your IDE, that too is “easy”. These are all easy tasks because they’re officially supported. You can install all three with one command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">sudo</span> pacman <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-S</span> r git code</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That installs the most recent R release, the current git release, and the current VS code release. It’s considerably easier than installing on a Ubuntu LTS release, especially for R, to be honest. On Ubuntu there’s a lot of messing about trying to get the latest versions. The Arch repositories are up to date, which does simplify matters considerably.</p>
<p>Things become a little trickier when you have to venture outside the official repositories. For example, suppose I want to use RStudio as my IDE. There isn’t an Arch package for RStudio, and – to the surprise of nobody – Posit doesn’t release one either. However, I’m hardly the first person to want to use RStudio on Arch, so it is equally unsurprising that the Arch community has stepped in to help fill the gap.</p>
<p>In other words, I’ve reached the point where I have to start installing from the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/">Arch user repository</a> (AUR). This is a community resource, so you have to be a bit more careful in checking that the packages you install from here are good ones, but that’s no different to investigating an R package before installing from CRAN or GitHub. It’s also really important to read through <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository">the AUR guidelines</a> <em>before</em> you start trying to use it, because it talks about the tools you’ll need to install first and has a nice walkthrough of the process. So I did that, installed everything from the <a href="https://archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/base-devel/">base-devel group</a> and got started…<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>There are a few different user submitted packages for RStudio on the AUR. The one I decided to use was <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rstudio-desktop-bin">rstudio-desktop-bin</a>, largely because it’s a binary<sup>4</sup> and because other Arch users seem to like it. It’s a multi-step process. First I had to get a copy of the package files. The easiest way is with git:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">git</span> clone https://aur.archlinux.org/rstudio-desktop-bin.git</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>rstudio-desktop-bin</code> folder that I just downloaded contains a <code>PKGBUILD</code> file… opening it in a text editor reveals that it’s basically a recipe for building a package. It doesn’t actually contain any of the components you need, and in fact for RStudio what you’ll notice when you take a peek at the inside is that it’s essentially a wrapper telling Arch how to use the <code>.deb</code> binary that Posit releases for Ubuntu/Debian systems.</p>
<p>To build the package I navigate to this folder and call <code>makepkg</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="bu" style="color: null;">cd</span> rstudio-desktop-bin</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">makepkg</span> <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-s</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>-s</code> flag attempts to synchronise: it will download and install any dependencies, as long as those are official dependencies (I think?). It doesn’t install dependencies when those are also packages on the AUR. Those you just have to do manually.</p>
<p>Anyway once <code>makepkg</code> does its job, you end up with a whole lot of new files in that folder. The one that we care most about is the one with the <code>.pkg.tar.zst</code> file extension. That’s the one that <code>pacman</code> can install:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">sudo</span> pacman <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-U</span> rstudio-desktop-bin-2022.12.0.353-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This will install RStudio and… it almost works. When I attempt to open RStudio I get a message in the Rstudio window complaining about a missing library. Digging into the comments on the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rstudio-desktop-bin">rstudio-desktop-bin</a> revealed the problem. One of the system dependencies for RStudio is missing from the PKGBUILD file: you have to install <code>openssl-1.1</code> to make it work. This did the trick for me:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb5-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">sudo</span> pacman <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-s</span> openssl-1.1</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And that’s it. Just like that I have RStudio running on Arch…</p>
<p>… and just like that I felt an immediate need to also get quarto running on Arch so that I could write this blog post on my new Arch box. Quarto is also available on the AUR, and I installed it using the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/quarto-cli">quarto-cli</a> package, following essentially the same process described above. There were no missing dependencies, and everything seems to work fine.</p>
<p>I’m suspicious. Things aren’t supposed to work first time. I fully expect my laptop to catch fire simply because I am doing something foolish.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="was-it-worth-it">Was it worth it?</h2>
<p>Probably not. But I don’t care. I had fun. Sometimes we do things because it’s useful to do them. Sometimes we do things because we like doing them. It’s important to know the difference. This was fun.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>We all saw this back in 2020, right? It seemed pretty funny to me at the time – 2020 was such a messed up year that it seemed hard to believe that 2022 could <em>really</em> be even stranger. Oh how very wrong I was.</p>

</div>
<p>My personal life has taken the biggest upheavals. After leaving academia in late 2021, I started my first ever tech job in January 2022… and was let go from my first ever tech job in December 2022. Not gonna lie, that one stings a bit, but mostly because it’s recent and I still haven’t really emotionally processed it all. I’m objective enough to recognise that the situation I’m in now really isn’t so bad. I lost a job that I was enjoying. I feel sad and hurt about losing it because I’m a normal human being who feels sad about things that are sad. It’ll pass. I’ll heal.</p>
<p>Besides, let’s be honest. In a year when I find myself in the situation where I can say things like “okay sure I’ve been sexually assaulted four times in the last 12 months, but technically speaking, only two of the men raped me” in a conversation and have it be entirely true, losing a job just doesn’t carry the level of trauma that it probably should.</p>
<p>On reflection, that is a very horrible sentence to have written.</p>
<p>But it is true. Sexual assault has been a recurring theme in 2022 for me, and while I don’t have much desire to talk about what it feels like to have been repeatedly violated in my personal life, I also don’t feel like I should be ashamed that it happened. I’m not going to make a secret of something that was not my fault. It happened, and I cannot change the fact that it happened. I’ve picked up the pieces as best I can and gone about my life again. What else can I do?</p>
<p>But let’s turn to happier topics, shall we? I’ve said the thing I wanted to say about the dark topics and there’s no need to dwell.</p>

</div>
</div></div><p>I keep a little log of things that I’ve been doing with my time, and it’s interesting to look back at what I was doing in January 2022. It feels like a lifetime ago: on January 9th I merged <a href="https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book/pull/260">a big pull request into the work-in-progress 3rd edition of the ggplot2 book</a> that reorganised the scales chapters. I haven’t had time to do anything else on that since January, but I really like how the writing worked out for that (plus it’s always fun to work with Hadley!) The book now has four separate chapters on scales. Three of the chapters focus on the practicalities of working with scales:</p>
<ul>
<li>Position scales: <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/scale-position.html">ggplot2-book.org/scale-position.html</a></li>
<li>Colour scales: <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/scale-colour.html">ggplot2-book.org/scale-colour.html</a></li>
<li>Scales for other aesthetics: <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/scale-other.html">ggplot2-book.org/scale-other.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There’s a fourth one too, which talks more about the underlying theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scales and guides <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/scales-guides.html">ggplot2-book.org/scales-guides.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Having done earlier work helping out with revising the <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/maps.html">Maps</a> and <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/annotations.html">Annotations</a> chapters, it felt really nice to be able to work on that. It’s possible I’ll have more time to revisit in 2023, but at this point all my plans are up in the air so who knows.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="writing-about-apache-arrow">Writing about Apache Arrow</h2>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-12-26_strange-year/arrow.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div></div><p>For most of the year I was gainfully employed to work on open source projects – Apache Arrow in particular – and I’ve written a lot over the last year about it. On this blog alone here’s what I wrote this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2021-11-19_starting-apache-arrow-in-r/">Getting started with Apache Arrow in R</a>. A now slightly dated primer on how to get started. Okay this one was technically November 2021, but it’s the logical beginning of the sequence of posts and I’m including anyway</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-01-18_binding-arrow-to-r/">Binding Apache Arrow to R</a>. A post about how the dplyr bindings in the arrow R package work and how you can write them yourself</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-03-04_data-types-in-arrow-and-r/">Data types in Arrow and R</a>. A very long post that walks you through the low level data types used by Arrow and R, and some of the subtle details around translating from one to the other</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-05-25_arrays-and-tables-in-arrow/">Arrays and tables in Arrow</a>. This post builds on the previous one and talks about some of the higher level data structures used in Apache Arrow (Arrays, Tables, Record Batches, etc), and the ways in which they are similar to and different from similar data structures in R (vectors, data frames, etc).</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-08-23_visualising-a-billion-rows/">How to visualise a billion rows of data in R with Apache Arrow</a>. This one was a practical post, walking you through the process of plotting a very large data set</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-09-09_reticulated-arrow/">Passing data between R and Python with reticulate</a> Part one of a two-part series about how you can use Arrow to pass data between R and Python without incurring serialisation costs. In part one I talked about it from an R-centric perspective, using the reticulate R package as the primary tool</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-09-16_arrow-and-rpy2/">Passing data between Python and R with rpy2</a> Part two of the same series. This one takes a Pythonic perspective and uses the rpy2 Python library as the primary tool</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-10-18_arrow-flight/">Building an Arrow Flight server</a>. One of the underrated features of the Arrow toolkit is that is the Flight RPC protocol: you can use it to efficiently communicate Arrow data over a network. This post is a walkthrough of how to do that in R and Python (mostly Python, really)</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-30_unpacking-arrow-datasets/">The Arrow Dataset API</a>. The last Arrow post I wrote this year talked about the Arrow Dataset API in more detail than I had done previously.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of these posts are… well, they’re long and they’re detailed. The intention was always to try to create a collection of useful resources with code walkthoughs that I could later fold back into documentation, books, workshops and so on. The nice thing is that this actually did happen. For example…</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote an entire workshop on <a href="https://arrow-user2022.netlify.app/">Larger than memory data workflows with Apache Arrow</a> for the R community. The slides, walkthrough, tutorial, etc are all up on the website</li>
<li>I contributed a chapter on Arrow to the 2nd edition of <a href="https://r4ds.hadley.nz/arrow.html">R for Data Science</a>. Given the centrality of R4DS in the R community I kind of feel like that’s probably one of the more useful things I actually managed to get done!</li>
</ul>
<p>But probably the biggest thing is that a lot of the content from my other writing worked its way into a <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/commit/4afe71030cdd9d3103c7b028082ba63bafdf5d27">big pull request</a> I wrote updating the documentation for the arrow R package. It hasn’t <em>quite</em> gone properly live yet, and I don’t think it will migrate to the front page until the 11.0.0 release in January, but it’s currently available on the dev version of the documentation.</p>
<ul>
<li>I completely rewrote the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/r/articles/arrow.html">Get started</a> page so that it is now more novice friendly and helps orient new users</li>
<li>I added a new article highlighting the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/r/articles/read_write.html">read/write capabilities</a> of Arrow</li>
<li>I added a new article talking about the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/r/articles/data_wrangling.html">data wrangling using the dplyr interface</a> that was partly new material, and partly reworked existing content</li>
<li>I tidied up the article on <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/r/articles/dataset.html">multi-file Dataset objects</a></li>
<li>I added a new article on <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/r/articles/data_objects.html">data objects in Arrow</a> that reworked a lot of content I’d originally written for my blog</li>
<li>I added a new article on <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/r/articles/data_types.html">data types in Arrow</a> that, again, reworked a lot of content I’d written for my blog</li>
<li>I laid the groundwork for a tidier discussion of <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/r/articles/metadata.html">metadata in Arrow</a> that I’d intended to expand on later</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, and I also wrote the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/visual_identity/">Arrow Visual Identity</a> page and all the code for generating the various logos!</p>
<p>There was a lot more I wanted to do with Arrow, to be honest. For example, the R package doesn’t handle Arrow Flight correctly at the moment (it works in special cases but it badly needs updating), and – before I found myself unemployed – I had talked about writing bindings so that the R package implemented the Arrow Flight protocol correctly. Maybe one day I’ll write them. I don’t think it’s actually very hard because the hard work is already done in the C++ library, but… oddly, I think I’ll take a bit of a break from Arrow work while I let my emotions about my employment situation settle.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-12-26_strange-year/hexagonal.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div></div><p>I made a lot of generative art in 2022, though maybe not quite as much as in 2021. I added nine new galleries on my art website <a href="https://art.djnavarro.net/">art.djnavarro.net</a>, but really the big thing for me in art this year was being invited to give a generative art workshop at rstudio::conf. So, thanks to the support of folks at Posit, there is now a fully fledged freely available tutorial – okay it’s closer to being an entire book, really – on how to make generative art with R. It’s online at <a href="https://art-from-code.netlify.app/">art-from-code.netlify.app</a>. It makes me really happy that I was lucky enough to be able to write that one. I was also interviewed for the DSxD book on <a href="https://datasciencebydesign.org/book">The Future of Data Science</a> for my artistic work! Oh, and one of my art pieces was used – with my permission freely given to the authors because they are lovely – as a the cover of a book on transgender sexual health, which I think is really cool.</p>

<section id="academia" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="academia">Academia</h2>
<p>Somehow, despite the fact that I am no longer in academia, I managed to publish some academic papers… in my spare time, like normal people do. To be fair though I didn’t actually do much of the work this year: these were all project that I’d committed to while I was still in academia. They were mostly papers that had been accepted or in the final stages of revision at the start of 2021 and have been slowly emerging from the pipeline one by one. It’s hard to know what to say about my academic output given that I’m no longer invested in the peculiar norms of the academia. It’s not my world anymore. I care a lot about some of the values, and so I’m still maintaining a personal archive as well as contributing my papers to institutional and other public archives, but… look, if ever you feel a need to ask “wait, what was Danielle’s academic research all about?” I moved all that to <a href="https://papers.djnavarro.net/">papers.djnavarro.net</a> at the end of 2022.</p>

</div></div><p>I did a lot of other things in 2022. There’s really no need to try to go through all of them. But here are some other personal favourites that made an appearance on this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wrote an R package on multi-threaded task queues: <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-12-22_queue/">blog.djnavarro.net/queue</a></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-what-happens-next">So what happens next?</h2>
<p>Arriving at the end of this post, I find myself very unsure about what comes next. It’s been such a strange year. I’m proud of the work that I’ve done and the projects I’ve completed. It feels good to be able to look at the list above and think yeah that’s actually a pretty decent body of work, and I could have added more if I’d wanted to. I think I’ve used my time well? I’ve accomplished a lot and learned a lot. But at the same time these things sit against a stunningly horrible backdrop, and it hasn’t been easy coping with that. In general I try not to talk about those kinds of topics on this blog – this is a data science blog, after all, and it’s not really a place for talking about sexual assault and what can do to your sense of self worth – but I suppose I would like it if 2023 goes a little differently. Not sure I can manage another year like this one.</p>

  <title>Queue</title>
  <dc:creator>Danielle Navarro</dc:creator>
  <link>https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-12-22_queue/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p>Okay. So I wrote a simple package for <a href="https://queue.djnavarro.net">multi-threaded tasks queues in R</a> this week. It wasn’t intentional, I swear. I was just trying to teach myself how to use the <a href="https://callr.r-lib.org/">callr</a> package,<sup>1</sup> and making sure I had a solid grasp of encapsulated object-oriented programming with <a href="https://r6.r-lib.org/">R6</a>. Things got a little out of hand. Sorry.</p>
<p>And let’s be very clear about something at the outset. If you want to do parallel computing in R correctly, you go look at <a href="https://www.futureverse.org/">futureverse.org</a>. The <a href="https://future.futureverse.org/">future</a> package by Henrik Bengtsson provides a fabulous way to execute R code asynchronously and in parallel. And there are many excellent packages built on top of that, so there’s a whole lovely ecosystem there just waiting for you.<sup>2</sup> Relatedly, if the reason you’re thinking about parallel computing is that you’ve found yourself with a burning need to analyse terabytes of data with R then babe it might be time to start learning some R workflows using <a href="https://therinspark.com/">Spark</a>, <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/category/apachearrow">Arrow</a>, <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/04/wtf-is-kubernetes-and-should-i-care-as-r-user/">Kubernetes</a>. It may be time to learn about some of those other eldritch words of power that have figured rather more prominently in my life than one might expect for a simple country girl.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>My little queue package is a personal project. I happen to like it, but you should not be looking at it as an alternative to serious tools.</p>
<p>That’s been said now. Good. We can put aside all pretension.</p>
<section id="what-does-it-do" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-it-do">What does it do?</h2>
<p>Let’s say I have a generative art function called <code>donut()</code>, based loosely on a <a href="https://art-from-code.netlify.app/day-1/session-1/#composition">teaching example from my art from code workshop</a>. The <code>donut()</code> function takes an input <code>seed</code>, creates a piece of generative art using ggplot2, and writes the output to an image file. This process takes several seconds to complete on my laptop:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/my-first-donut_78cc3a9337022adc6a85a72fd51f194e">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">library</span>(tictoc)</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">tic</span>()</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">donut</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">seed =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">100</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">toc</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>5.277 sec elapsed</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here’s the piece, by the way:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-12-22_queue/donut_100.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>That’s nice and I do like this piece, but generative art is an iterative process and I like to make many pieces at once to help me get a feel for the statistical properties of the system. Waiting five or six seconds for one piece to render is one thing: waiting 8-10 minutes for 100 pieces to render is quite another. So it’s helpful if I can do this in parallel.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">library</span>(queue)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here’s how I might do that using queue. I designed the package using R6 classes – more on that later – so we’ll be working in the “encapsulated” object oriented programming style that is more common in other programming languages. The first step is to initialise a <a href="https://queue.djnavarro.net/reference/Queue.html"><code>Queue</code></a> object, specifying the number of workers we want to use. I’ll use six:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/my-first-queue_dfc1ff39dc3ddb607ec985d5339378c1">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1">queue <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> Queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">new</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">workers =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">6</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>When I do this, the queue package starts six R sessions for us, and all my computations will be done in those R sessions. Under the hood, all the hard work of managing the R sessions is being done by the wonderful callr package by Gábor Csárdi<sup>4</sup> – the only thing that queue does is provide a layer of abstraction and automation to the whole process.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll add some tasks to the queue. <code>Queue</code> objects have an <code>add()</code> method that take a function and a list of arguments, so I can do this to push a task to the queue:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/my-first-task_e9d06a818d4aab8856c997131ca80f42">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1">queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">add</span>(donut, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">args =</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">list</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">seed =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">100</span>))</span></code></pre></div>

<p>When the queue executes, it will be in a “first in, first out” order,<sup>5</sup> so this task will be the first one to be assigned to a worker. Though of course that’s no guarantee that it will be the first one to finish!</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s load up several more tasks. There’s some weird aversion out there to using loops in R, but this isn’t one of those situations where we need to worry about unnecessary copying, so I’m going to use a loop:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/load-several-tasks_5cc68af5a47beff90603fa0c398907e3">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1"><span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">for</span>(s <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">in</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">101</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">108</span>) queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">add</span>(donut, <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">list</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">seed =</span> s))</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>So now we have nine tasks loaded onto a queue with six workers. To start it running I call the <code>run()</code> method for the queue. By default, all you’d see while the queue is running is a spinner with a progress message telling you how many tasks have completed so far, how many are currently running, and how many are still waiting. But I’ll ask it to be a bit more chatty. I’ll call it setting <code>message = "verbose"</code> so that we can see a log showing the order in which the tasks completed and time each task took to complete, in addition to the total time elapsed on my system while the queue was running:</p>

<p>So it’s a three-step process: (1) create the queue, (2) load up the tasks, (3) execute the tasks. In practice I would probably simplify the code to this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb18" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb18-1">queue <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> Queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">new</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">workers =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">6</span>)</span>

</div>
<p>True, I could simplify it further. For example, if I know that I’m always calling the same function and always passing the same the same arguments – just with different values – this could be wrapped up in <a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/">purrr</a> style syntax, but honestly I’m not sure why I would bother doing that when <a href="https://furrr.futureverse.org/">furrr</a> already exists? I’m not planning to reinvent the wheel, especially not when Davis Vaughn already offers a fully-operational mass-transit system free of charge.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-does-it-store">What does it store?</h2>
<p>The output object <code>out</code> stores quite a lot of information about the tasks, the results, and the events that occurred during task execution, but most of it isn’t immediately interesting to us (especially when things actually work!) So let’s keep things simple for the moment and just look at the first five columns:</p>
<div class="cell">

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

</div>
<p>The columns are pretty self-explanatory I think?</p>
<ul>
<li><code>task_id</code> is a unique identifier for the task itself</li>
<li><code>worker_id</code> is a unique identifier for the worker that completed the task (it’s also the process id for the R session)</li>
<li><code>state</code> summarises the current state of the task (they’re all <code>"done"</code> because the queue is finished)</li>
<li><code>result</code> is a list column containing the output from each task</li>
<li><code>runtime</code> is a difftime column telling you how long each task took to finish</li>
</ul>

<p>Okay so there’s a bit more to unpack here. Let’s take a look…</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>fun</code> and <code>args</code> columns contain the functions and arguments that were originally used to specify the task</li>
<li>The <code>created</code>, <code>queued</code>, <code>assigned</code>, <code>started</code>, and <code>finished</code> columns contain POSIXct timestamps indicating when the task was created, added to a queue, assigned to a worker, started running on a worker, and returned from the worker</li>
<li><code>code</code> is a numeric code returned by the callr R session: of particular note 200 means it returned successfully, 500 means the session exited cleanly, and 501 means the session crashed</li>
<li><code>message</code> is a message returned by callr</li>
<li><code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> are the contents of the output and error streams from the worker session while the task was running</li>
<li><code>error</code> currently is <code>NULL</code> because I haven’t implemented that bit yet lol.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="surviving-a-crash">Surviving a crash</h2>
<p>I’m going to be honest. Sometimes<sup>6</sup> I write bad code when I am exploring a new generative art system. Code that crashes the R session unpredictably. So it would be nice if the queue had a little bit of robustness for that. To be honest, the queue package isn’t very sophisticated in detecting sessions that have crashed,<sup>7</sup> but it does have some ability to recover when a task crashes its thread. Let’s keep this simple. I’ll define a perfectly safe function that waits for a moment and then returns, and another function that always crashes the R session as soon as it is called:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb23" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb23-1">wait <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">function</span>(x) {</span>
<span id="cb23-2">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">Sys.sleep</span>(x)</span>
<span id="cb23-3">  x</span>
<span id="cb23-4">}</span>
<span id="cb23-5">crash <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">function</span>(x) <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">.Call</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"abort"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now let’s define a queue that has only two workers, but has no less than three tasks that are guaranteed to crash the worker the moment the tasks are started:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb24" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb24-1">queue <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> Queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">new</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">workers =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">2</span>)</span>
<span id="cb24-2">queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">add</span>(wait, <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">list</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">x =</span> .<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span>))</span>
<span id="cb24-3">queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">add</span>(crash)</span>
<span id="cb24-4">queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">add</span>(crash)</span>
<span id="cb24-5">queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">add</span>(crash)</span>
<span id="cb24-6">queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">add</span>(wait, <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">list</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">x =</span> .<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The queue allocates task in a first-in first-out order, so the three “crash tasks” are guaranteed to be allocated before the final “wait task”. Let’s take a look at what happens when the queue runs:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb25" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb25-1">queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">run</span>()</span></code></pre></div>

<p>It’s a little slower than we’d hope, but it does finish both valid tasks and returns nothing for the tasks that crashed their R sessions. What has happened in the background is that the queue runs a simple check to see if any of the R sessions have crashed, and attempts to replace them with a new worker whenever it detects that this has happened. It’s not in any sense optimised, but it does sort of work.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="design">Design</h2>
<p>Although my confidence in my ability to have a career in tech is at an all-time low, I have to admit that the work I’ve done over the last year has made me a better programmer. I didn’t much effort into writing queue, but the code feels cleaner and more modular than the code I was writing a year ago. Good practices have become habits, I suppose. That’s a nice feeling. I automatically write proper unit tests as I go, knowing that those tests will save me when I need to make changes later. I document properly as I go, knowing that I won’t remember a bloody thing about how my own code works six hours later – never mind six months. And, maybe most importantly of all, my code now seems to have this habit of organising itself into small, manageable abstractions. I have no idea when that happened, because I wasn’t actually part of a software engineering team. I was just the girl who wrote some docs and few little blog posts.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Here’s what I mean. If you take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/djnavarro/queue/blob/4c70aad373fd518250c6bd6c29cebccb6d16dc65/R/queue.R">source code for the <code>Queue</code></a> object, it’s actually not very long: the file is mostly devoted to the documentation, and the object doesn’t have very many methods. Honestly, we’ve already seen most of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>new()</code> creates a new queue</li>
<li><code>add()</code> adds a task to a queue</li>
<li><code>run()</code> sets the queue running</li>
</ul>
<p>If everything works smoothly you don’t need anything else, so why burden the user with extra details? Sure, there’s a little complexity to these methods which is of course documented on the <a href="https://queue.djnavarro.net/reference/Queue.html">relevant pkgdown page</a> because I’m not a jerk, but this isn’t a complicated package…</p>
<p>…when it’s working.</p>
<p>Of course, when things start to break, you start to care a lot more about the internals. Fair enough. There are two important data structures within the <code>Queue</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internally, a <code>Queue</code> manages a <a href="https://queue.djnavarro.net/reference/WorkerPool.html"><code>WorkerPool</code></a> comprised of one or more <a href="https://queue.djnavarro.net/reference/Worker.html"><code>Worker</code></a> objects. As you’d expect given the names, these provide abstractions for managing the R sessions. A <code>Worker</code> object provides a wrapper around a callr R session, and tools that automate the interaction between that session and a task.</li>
<li>The <code>Queue</code> also holds a <a href="https://queue.djnavarro.net/reference/TaskList.html"><code>TaskList</code></a> comprised of one or more <a href="https://queue.djnavarro.net/reference/Task.html"><code>Task</code></a> objects. Again, as you might expect from the names, these are the storage classes. A <code>Task</code> object is a container that holds a function, its arguments, any results it might have returned, and any logged information about the process of its execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some situations it can be awfully handy to have access to these constituent data structures, particularly because those objects expose additional tools that I deliberately chose not to make available at the <code>Queue</code> level. From the <code>Queue</code> itself what you can do is return the objects:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb28" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb28-1">workers <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">get_workers</span>()</span>
<span id="cb28-2">tasks <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> queue<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">get_tasks</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>These objects are R6 classes: they have reference semantics so anything I do with <code>workers</code> and <code>tasks</code> will have corresponding effects on <code>queue</code>. For this blog post I don’t intend to dive into details of what I did when designing the <code>WorkerPool</code> and <code>TaskList</code> classes – especially because queue is only at version 0.0.2 and I don’t yet know what I’m going to do with this cute little package – but I’ll give one example.</p>
<p>Let’s take the workers. By default, a <code>Queue</code> cleans up after itself and closes any R sessions that it started. The <code>WorkerPool</code> object associated with a <code>Queue</code> has a <code>get_pool_state()</code> method that I can use to check the state of the workers, and some other methods to modify the workers if I so choose. Let’s have a go. I ask <code>workers</code> to report on the status of the R sessions, this is what I get:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb29" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb29-1">workers<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">get_pool_state</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>    624484     624496 
"finished" "finished" </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yes, as expected the workers have stopped. But I can replace them with live R sessions by calling the <code>refill_pool()</code> method:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb31" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb31-1">workers<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">refill_pool</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>624512 624524 
"idle" "idle" </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And I can shut them down again by calling <code>shutdown_pool()</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb33" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb33-1">workers<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">shutdown_pool</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>    624512     624524 
"finished" "finished" </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Along similar lines the <code>TaskList</code> object has some methods that let me manipulate the data storage associated with my <code>Queue</code>. Normally I don’t need to. Sometimes I do. It’s handy to have those tools lying around. At the moment the toolkit feels a little light, but the nice thing about writing your own package is that I can always add more if I need them :-)</p>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p>What am I doing? Why am I here? Oh that’s right. So I was having coffee this morning reading the nerd news on mastodon as a girl likes to do and this <a href="https://mas.to/@kims/109525496705672156">this very cool post about crayon colours</a> by Kim Scheinberg caught my attention.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>The image comes from <a href="http://www.datapointed.net/2010/01/crayola-crayon-color-chart/">this blog post</a> by Stephen Von Worley – he has a <a href="http://www.datapointed.net/2010/10/crayola-color-chart-rainbow-style/">follow up</a> too. Interesting. I realise I am of course about to waste half a day on this…</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="its-the-prologue-baby">It’s the prologue, baby</h2>
<p>Having read the blog posts by Von Worley I worked out that the source of the data is the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors">list of Crayola crayon colours</a>, and as it happens I know how to pull data from Wikipedia tables into R. Thanks to <a href="https://ivelasq.rbind.io/blog/politely-scraping/">this amazing post</a> by Isabella Velásquez, I’d learned all about using the <a href="https://dmi3kno.github.io/polite/">polite</a> package to make sure that my webscraping is appropriate and respectful, and using the <a href="https://rvest.tidyverse.org/">rvest</a> package to do the actual scraping. What I had assumed, is that reading the table into R was going to be a simple matter of writing some code like this…</p>

<p>… I encounter a rather awkward problem. The <code>color</code> field, which renders on the Wikipedia page as a pretty block of colour showing what the crayon colour looks like, is empty. Sure, I do have text containing hex codes for some of the crayons, but the missing data isn’t missing at random. Old crayon colours are the ones systematically missing an official hex code. Okay, so I really would like to have some data in my <code>color</code> column.</p>

<p>Now where was I? What’s that maxim about never using background colour to encode substantive data in a table? I seem to have run afoul of that. Let’s take a look at the elements of the html table and see if I can work out where things went wrong…</p>

<p>Okay yeah. You can see the problem looking at the 1st and 10th line of the output here. The piece of information we need is embedded in the css style attribute, and it’s <em>only</em> in the style metadata attribute. There’s no data in the actual “td” element for <code>html_table()</code> to capture. I’m going to have to fix that myself I guess. Sigh.</p>
<p>The first part of my process was to find the relevant subset of cells. There’s probably a better way to do it, but my approach was based on noting that (a) it’s really easy to find the cells containing the colour names (“Red”, “Maroon”, etc), and (b) the cell to the left of it is always the one that has the background colour that I’m looking for. So, my first step was to manually pull out the text in each cell. That’s easy to do with rvest thanks to the <code>html_text()</code> function, and just to make my life a little easier I used <a href="https://stringr.tidyverse.org/">stringr</a> to remove all the <code>\n</code> characters at the end of each cell:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb12" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb12-1">cell_text <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> cells <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>

<span id="cb12-3">  stringr<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">str_remove_all</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">\n</span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">$"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>And here’s the text in the first 20 cells:</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>So when I now match this text against the colour names stored in <code>crayola$name</code>, I’ll detect “Red” in cell 2, “Maroon” in cell 11, and so on. If I subtract 1 from each of these values, I now have the indices of the table cells that contain the style information I need.</p>

<p>That’s much nicer. Now I have something with a consistent format that I can process without too much pain. The rvest package has a <code>html_attr()</code> function which I can use to pull out the contents of the style attribute as a string. So, after spending a few minutes trying to remember how regular expressions work, I used <code>str_extract()</code> to pull out the hexadecimal codes like this:</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>There are several problems I’m going to need to solve to get this into a regular form:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “circa” text will have to be removed</li>
<li>White spaces will need to be removed</li>
<li>Footnote text will need to be removed</li>
<li>The word “present” will have to be replaced by “2022”</li>
<li>The single year “1958” will need to be replaced by an interval “1958-1958”</li>
<li>The comma separated list “2021,2022” will need to be an interval “2021-2022”</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a little bit of stringr code that does that:</p>

<p>That’s better because the data format is now consistent, but it’s not tidy. In the long run, what I really want is a nice tidy tibble: each row should correspond to a single observation. If “Red” was a colour in 1935, then there should be a row in my table for which <code>name = "Red"</code> and <code>year = 1935</code>. That’s not quite what I have here, so I have more data wrangling to do and this time <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/">tidyr</a> will be my best friend.</p>
<p>The first thing I’m going to do is use <code>tidyr::separate()</code> to split the <code>years</code> variable into two variables, <code>years_1</code> and <code>years_2</code>. The <code>years_1</code> variable will contain the first time interval for which a particular crayon colour was in production, and the <code>years_2</code> variable will contain the second interval in which it was in production. For almost all colours, <code>years_2</code> will be <code>NA</code>. It’s only those special cases like <code>"1903–1910,1930–1990"</code> that will have values in both.</p>
<p>Then, because I don’t really see a need to have two variables that both represent a period of time, I’ll use <code>tidyr::pivot_longer()</code> to give myself a data set in which there is one row for every continuous time interval:</p>

<p>The “Maroon” crayon has been in production continuously since 1949, so there is only one row in the table for that one. The “Violet-Blue” crayon was in production from 1903 to 1910, and again from 1930 to 1990. These two production periods are each represented as a row.</p>
<p>Excellent. Next, I’ll use <code>separate()</code> again to split the <code>years</code> interval into two columns, one for the <code>year_started</code> and another for the <code>year_ended</code>. Having done so, the year information is finally in a numeric format, so I can coerce it from character to integer:</p>

<p>We’re getting close. At this point the last bit of work I have to do to fix the year data is unpack it. Instead of representing the data for Maroon crayons with one row with a <code>year_started</code> value of 1949 and <code>year_ended</code> value of 2022, I want to have a single column called <code>year</code>, and the data should contain one row for every year in which Maroon was in production. Somewhere in the back of my head there is the thought that there must be an easy way to do this with tidyr, but my ingenuity failed me this time and I fell back on my usual solution… <a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/">purrr</a>.</p>
<p>It’s a two-step process. Step one: write a little function that expects to receive the values stored in one row of the existing data frame, and returns a new data frame in the format I want. In this case, I want a tibble that has one row for each <code>year</code> in range starting <code>year_started</code> and ending <code>year_ended</code>, but otherwise has the same structure as the existing data. The <code>unpack_row()</code> function below does that:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb34" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb34-1">unpack_row <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">function</span>(color, name, year_started, year_ended, ...) {</span>
<span id="cb34-2">  tibble<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">tibble</span>(</span>
<span id="cb34-3">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">name =</span> name,</span>
<span id="cb34-4">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">color =</span> color,</span>
<span id="cb34-5">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">year =</span> year_started<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span>year_ended,</span>
<span id="cb34-6">    ...</span>
<span id="cb34-7">  )</span>
<span id="cb34-8">}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>So now I’ll do the unpacking with <code>purrr::pmap_dfr()</code>, sort the rows into a nice order using <code>dplyr::arrange()</code>, and add an <code>id</code> column to ensure that every row in the table has a unique identifier:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb35" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb35-1">crayola <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> crayola <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb35-2">  purrr<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">pmap_dfr</span>(unpack_row) <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb35-3">  dplyr<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">arrange</span>(year, color) <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>

<p>Okay I have one last thing to do before I’m done with the data wrangling. Having hex strings associated with each crayon colour is nice and is exactly what I need for plotting, but you can’t construct a nice ordering of colours since colour space is three dimensional, more or less. I’m trying my very best to forget everything I ever learned about the psychophysics of human colour perception, but even so I’m not silly enough to try to work with raw RGB values. Instead I’ll use the <a href="http://colorspace.r-forge.r-project.org/">colorspace</a> package to convert extract hue/saturation/value coordinates, as well as my slightly-preferred method, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELUV">CIELUV color coordinates</a>:</p>

</div>
<p>Each of these commands returns a matrix with three columns and the same number of rows as the <code>crayola</code> data frame. The first few rows of the <code>HSV</code> matrix look like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb39" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb39-1">HSV[<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">10</span>,]</span></code></pre></div>

<p>So now I can store all six coordinates in the <code>crayola</code> dataframe, along with the LUV-space version of “hue” which I compute in the last line here:</p>

</div>
<p>The Wikipedia page on CIELUV has a little more information on this, but really the thing that matters is that the <code>hue2</code> column is the variable I’m going to use to arrange the crayon colours when plotting them later. And so the moment arrives that, at long last, I have the data…</p>

<p>As a rule I make it a habit to assume that, while the internet never forgets anything at all in the general sense, it doesn’t remember anything <em>specific</em> for any interval longer than I’d trust a man not to have conveniently lost my phone number. Moreover, while I also make it a habit not to care greatly about the archival properties of What Went Down In The Stalls At The Duke On Friday, I’m slightly more invested in, um … crayons, I guess. Or data science practices in R. Whatever.</p>
<p>My point here is that the table on wikipedia isn’t an archival source so there’s no guarantee that anything I’ve done up to this point is reproducible unless I do a bit of extra work myself and save a copy of the data…</p>

<p>Oh let’s just get on with it and load <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot2</a> already. Here’s a stacked bar chart showing the number of distinct crayon colours in the Crayola standard set every year from 1903 to 2022. It has grown over time but the growth looks linear, not exponential:</p>

<p>But let’s be honest, shall we? No-one at all (least of all me) is interested in determining whether the rate of growth of Crayola crayon colours in the standard set is exponential or linear. It’s just fun. The real reason we all love the Crayola post was that the image was so terribly pretty, so let’s start making something pretty, yes?</p>
<p>We can start getting something a little closer to the original if we set <code>position = "fill"</code>, and I’m going to use <code>theme_void()</code> because honestly it’s just prettier without the words and numbers getting in the way…</p>

<p>It’s pretty, but it’s noticeably different from the original one. In my version, there are 39 separate colours depicted on the left hand side, whereas the version that was going around on mastodon (and appears in the original blog posts) has only 8. Out of paranoia, I decided to check the counts in my data…</p>

<p>…which does seem consistent with what the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Crayola_crayons">history of Crayola crayons</a> wikipedia article has to say on the topic too:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Early Crayola advertising mentions thirty different colors, although there is no official list; in fact thirty-eight different crayons are known from Crayola boxes of this period. The largest labeled assortment was box No.&nbsp;51, titled Crayola Young Artists’ Drawing Crayons, which included twenty-eight different crayons. Other colors were found in different boxes, including the “Rubens” No.&nbsp;500, a twenty-four crayon assortment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so if I haven’t made a mistake, what is going on? It turns out that although Steven Von Worley’s blog post still manages to point to the “same” Wikipedia page 12 years later, the contents of the page have changed considerably. The original post was published January 15th 2010. Conveniently the wayback machine has a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100209002742/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayola_crayon_colors">snapshot of that page</a> from only a few weeks later, on February 9th. I have a very different version of the Crayola colours data than Steven’s friend Velociraptor had.</p>
<p>There are 133 colours listed in the 2010 version, and it’s missing all the colours that had gone out of production earlier than 1990. “English Vermillion”, for example, was in production from 1903 to 1935. It appears in the 2022 version of the Wikipedia data (and so it’s represented in my plots above), but it was omitted in the 2010 version of the Wikipedia data and so doesn’t appear in the version of the image that went around on Mastodon yesterday.</p>
<p>Hm. So what happens to my data if I crudely simulate a censoring process a little bit like the one that applied to the 2010 version of the Wikipedia page? Let’s simply ignore all crayon colours that were out of production earlier than 1990, shall we?</p>

<p>Still not exactly equivalent, but it’s closer.</p>
<p>More to the point however, I think we all have to admit that this is really the kind of data set that desperately needs to be plotted with the aid of <code>coord_polar()</code>, no?</p>

<p>I mean… not that anyone really cares what this represents, but each concentric ring represents a year of data: 1903 is in the middle, and 2022 is on the outside. Within each annual ring there is an equal-angle segment for every crayon colour in the data for that year. Whenever the crayons changed, the rings shift a bit. The colours are arranged around the circle by hue. Well, the hue-like quantity computed from the chromaticity components of the LUV coordinates. Whatever.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could turn this into a racetrack plot, where each individual colour fills an angular section of constant size, and so only the year with the most crayon colours (2022) wraps the full way round the circle. That gives us this:</p>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p>Hello again lovely people. I am, once again, blogging about Apache Arrow and I’m not even sorry. Oh well.</p>
<p>In an earlier post I wrote about <a href="../../posts/2022-05-25_arrays-and-tables-in-arrow/index.html">Tables and other in-memory data structures</a> that Arrow uses to represent data objects. That meant the bulk of the post was focused on Record Batch and Table objects and the constituent objects used to define columns in one of these things (Arrays and Chunked Arrays).</p>
<p>What I didn’t <em>really</em> talk about in that post was Datasets, which are used to represent data (typically larger-than-memory data) that are stored on-disk rather than in-memory. Okay, fine, yeah. Technically I did include a <a href="../../posts/2022-05-25_arrays-and-tables-in-arrow/index.html#datasets">section on Datasets</a> at the end of the post, but I was a bit evasive. I gave an example showing how to use Datasets, but I really didn’t talk much about what they are.</p>
<p>I had a very good reason for this, dear reader, and that reason is this: when I wrote that post I had no f**king idea whatsoever how Datasets worked. I knew how to use them, but if you’d asked me questions about how the magic works I couldn’t have told you.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Since that time I’ve learned a few things, and because I’m an annoying person I’m going to tell you about them.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>At this point I’ve written <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/category/apache-arrow">quite a few posts about Arrow</a>, and it’s not necessarily a good idea for me to assume that you’ve had the misfortune to read all<sup>3</sup> of them. So here’s a quick recap of some of the key Arrow data structures that I’ve talked about in other posts…</p>
<p>Let’s start with Record Batches. A Record Batch is tabular data structure comprised of named Arrays,<sup>4</sup> and an accompanying Schema<sup>5</sup> that specifies the name and data type associated with each Array. We can create one manually using <code>record_batch()</code></p>

</div>
<p>This is a Record Batch containing 5 rows and 3 columns. The command <code>rb[1:3, 1:2]</code> extracts the first three rows and the first two columns:</p>

</div>
<p>The structure of a Record Batch is shown below. In addition to the three Arrays specifying the columns, it includes an explicit Schema object containing relevant metadata:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-30_unpacking-arrow-datasets/img/record_batch.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Record Batches are a fundamental unit for data interchange in Arrow, but are not typically used for data analysis. The reason for this is that the constituent Arrays that store columns in a Record Batch are immutable: they cannot be modified or extended without creating a new object.<sup>6</sup> When data arrive sequentially Record Batches can be inconvenient, because you can’t concatenate them. For that reason Tables are usually more practical…</p>
<p>So let’s turn to Tables next. From the user perspective a Table is very similar to a Record Batch but the constituent parts are Chunked Arrays. Chunked Arrays are flexible wrappers enclosing one or more Arrays.<sup>7</sup> This makes it possible to concatenate tables. To quickly illustrate this, let’s first convert the <code>rb</code> Record Batch to a Table using <code>arrow_table()</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1">df1 <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">arrow_table</span>(rb)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we create a second Table with the same column names and types, again using <code>arrow_table()</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1">df2 <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">arrow_table</span>(</span>
<span id="cb7-2">  <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">strs =</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">c</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"I"</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"love"</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"you"</span>), </span>
<span id="cb7-3">  <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">ints =</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">c</span>(5L, 0L, 0L),</span>
<span id="cb7-4">  <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">dbls =</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">c</span>(<span class="fl" style="color: #AD0000;">7.1</span>, <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">-</span><span class="fl" style="color: #AD0000;">0.1</span>, <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">2</span>)</span>
<span id="cb7-5">)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can concatenate these using <code>concat_tables()</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1">df <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">concat_tables</span>(df1, df2)</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">glimpse</span>(df)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Table
8 rows x 3 columns
$ strs &lt;string&gt; "hello", "amazing", "and", "cruel", "world", "I", "love", "you"
$ ints  &lt;int32&gt; 1, NA, 2, 4, 8, 5, 0, 0
$ dbls &lt;double&gt; 1.1, 3.2, 0.2, NA, 11.0, 7.1, -0.1, 2.0</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The structure of this Table object is similar to the structure of the Record Batch object I showed earlier, but the columns are Chunked Arrays rather than simple Arrays:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-30_unpacking-arrow-datasets/img/table.png" class="img-fluid"> You can see this if we print out a single column:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb10" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1">df<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span>strs</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>ChunkedArray
&lt;string&gt;
[
  [
    "hello",
    "amazing",
    "and",
    "cruel",
    "world"
  ],
  [
    "I",
    "love",
    "you"
  ]
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>There’s a visual separation there between the different chunks, used to indicated where the boundaries between individual Arrays are. In practice though you actually don’t have to care about this because it’s not semantically meaningful. It’s there for purely technical reasons.</p>
<p>But all this is background. So let’s move on, shall we?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="so-datasets">So… Datasets?</h2>
<p>Okay, what about Datasets? Like Record Batch and Table objects, a Dataset is used to represent tabular data. At an abstract level, a Dataset can be viewed as an object comprised of rows and columns, and just like Record Batches and Tables, it contains an explicit Schema that specifies the name and data type associated with each column.</p>
<p>However, where Tables and Record Batches are data explicitly represented in-memory, a Dataset is not. Instead, a Dataset is an abstraction that refers to data stored on-disk in one or more files. Reading the data takes place only as needed, and only when a query is executed against the data. In this respect Arrow Datasets are a very different kind of object to Arrow Tables, but the arrow package is written in a way that the dplyr commands used to analyze Tables can also be applied to Datasets.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-a-dataset-on-disk">What is a Dataset on-disk?</h2>
<p>Reduced to its simplest form, the on-disk structure of a Dataset is simply a collection of data files, each storing one subset of the data. These subsets are sometimes referred to as “fragments”, and the partitioning process is sometimes referred to as “sharding”. To illustrate how this works, I’ll write a multi-file dataset to disk manually, without using any of the Arrow Dataset functionality to do the work. I’ll keep it deliberately simple and use three small data frames, each containing one subset of the data we want to store:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb12" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb12-1">df_a <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">data.frame</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">id =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">5</span>, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">value =</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">rnorm</span>(<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">5</span>), <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">subset =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"a"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb12-2">df_b <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">data.frame</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">id =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">6</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">10</span>, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">value =</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">rnorm</span>(<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">5</span>), <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">subset =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"b"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb12-3">df_c <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">data.frame</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">id =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">11</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">15</span>, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">value =</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">rnorm</span>(<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">5</span>), <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">subset =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"c"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Our intention is that each of the data frames should be stored in a separate data file. As you can see, this is a quite structured partitioning: all data where <code>subset = "a"</code> belong to one file, all data where <code>subset = "b"</code> belong to another file, and all data where <code>subset = "c"</code> belong to the third file.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>The first step is to define and create a folder that will hold all the files:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb13" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb13-1">ds_dir <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"mini-dataset"</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">dir.create</span>(ds_dir)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The next step is to manually create a “Hive-style”<sup>9</sup> folder structure:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb14" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb14-1">ds_dir_a <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">file.path</span>(ds_dir, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"subset=a"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb14-2">ds_dir_b <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">file.path</span>(ds_dir, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"subset=b"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb14-3">ds_dir_c <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">file.path</span>(ds_dir, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"subset=c"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb14-4"></span>
<span id="cb14-5"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">dir.create</span>(ds_dir_a)</span>
<span id="cb14-6"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">dir.create</span>(ds_dir_b)</span>
<span id="cb14-7"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">dir.create</span>(ds_dir_c)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Notice that we have named each folder in a “key=value” format that exactly describes the subset of data that will be written into that folder. This naming structure is the essence of Hive-style partitions.</p>
<p>Now that we have the folders, we’ll use <code>write_parquet()</code> to create a single <a href="https://parquet.apache.org">parquet file</a><sup>10</sup> for each of the three subsets:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb15" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb15-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">write_parquet</span>(df_a, <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">file.path</span>(ds_dir_a, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"part-0.parquet"</span>))</span>
<span id="cb15-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">write_parquet</span>(df_b, <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">file.path</span>(ds_dir_b, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"part-0.parquet"</span>))</span>
<span id="cb15-3"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">write_parquet</span>(df_c, <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">file.path</span>(ds_dir_c, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"part-0.parquet"</span>))</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>If I’d wanted to, I could have further subdivided the dataset. A folder can contain multiple files (<code>part-0.parquet</code>, <code>part-1.parquet</code>, etc) if we would like it to, though there’s no point whatsoever in doing that with such a tiny dataset. Similarly, there is no requirement to name the files <code>part-0.parquet</code> this way at all: it would have been fine to call these files <code>subset-a.parquet</code>, <code>subset-b.parquet</code>, and <code>subset-c.parquet</code> if I’d wanted to do that. I only chose <code>part-0.parquet</code> because that’s the default filename that the <code>write_dataset()</code> function in the arrow package generates!</p>
<p>Along the same lines, it isn’t <em>necessary</em> to use Hive-style partitions to use Arrow Datasets. The default behaviour of <code>write_dataset()</code> is to construct Hive-style partitions, and the default in <code>open_dataset()</code> is to look for Hive-style partitions, but it isn’t required.</p>
<p>In any case, I’ve created an on-disk parquet Dataset using Hive-style partitioning. My Dataset is defined by these files:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb16" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">list.files</span>(ds_dir, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">recursive =</span> <span class="cn" style="color: #8f5902;">TRUE</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] "subset=a/part-0.parquet" "subset=b/part-0.parquet"
[3] "subset=c/part-0.parquet"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is exciting, right? I mean, I’m excited. How could anyone not be completely enthralled by this thrilling exposition?</p>
<p>Aaaaanyway…. to verify that everything has worked, I’ll now try to open the data with <code>open_dataset()</code> and call <code>glimpse()</code> to inspect its contents:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb18" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb18-1">ds <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">open_dataset</span>(ds_dir)</span>
<span id="cb18-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">glimpse</span>(ds)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>FileSystemDataset with 3 Parquet files
15 rows x 3 columns
$ id      &lt;int32&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

</div>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the <code>ds</code> Dataset object aggregates the three separate data files. In fact, in this particular case the Dataset is so small that values from all three files appear in the output of <code>glimpse()</code>.</p>
<p>Now, it’s pretty obvious that I wouldn’t use this workflow in my everyday life. Manually writing individual files like this is tiresome, especially when the exact same dataset can be created with the following command:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb20" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb20-1">ds <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span> </span>

</div>
<p>As an aside, even if <code>ds</code> happens to refer to an on-disk Dataset that is larger than memory, and you’re just wanting to rewrite it with a different file structure, this pipeline should still work without any risk of an out-of-memory error. This is thanks to the Dataset backpressure functionality<sup>11</sup> in which the reader will back off and slow down if the writer has fallen too far behind and the memory cache is filling up. Or something like that. Look, I almost managed to make myself care about the details, okay?</p>

<p>Assuming I have any readers left at this point in the post, I know what you’re all thinking:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yes okay Danielle that’s fine, I get it, a Dataset is just a bunch of files on disk. But actually I already knew that. There has to be <em>something</em> in-memory though right? What’s that thing? Tell me about that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First off, rude. I was getting to it! Second, yes you are totally right. Sorry. So okay, in the last section I created this the <code>ds</code> object. Like most objects created by the arrow package, it’s an R6 object with a bunch of fields and methods that are used to wrap bindings to the corresponding Arrow C++ dark magic… sorry, um, methods. Anyway, for our purposes there are two things of importance: the <code>ds</code> object has an active binding specifying the Schema of the Dataset, and another one specifying the paths to all the files. That’s pretty much it. Paths to these files are stored in an active binding <code>ds$files</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Schema

</div>
</div>
<p>By default this Schema is inferred by <code>open_dataset()</code> by inspecting the first file only, though it is possible to construct a unified schema after inspecting all files. To do this, set <code>unify_schemas = TRUE</code> when calling <code>open_dataset()</code>. It is also possible to use the <code>schema</code> argument to <code>open_dataset()</code> to specify the Schema explicitly (see the <code>schema()</code> function for details).</p>
<p>In any case, in most situations I think it’s reasonable to use this as the mental model of what the <code>ds</code> object contains:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-does-a-dataset-query-work">How does a Dataset query work?</h2>
<p>Hm. So if the Dataset object<sup>12</sup> is essentially nothing more than a Schema and a list of files, what happens at the time a query has to be evaluated? At some point the data (or at least some of it) do have to be read into memory in order to perform the compute operations! I mean, consider the following dplyr pipeline:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb25" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb25-1">ds <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb25-2">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">filter</span>(value <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">&gt;</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">0</span>) <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb25-3">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">mutate</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">new_value =</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">round</span>(<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">100</span> <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">*</span> value)) <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb25-4">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">select</span>(id, subset, new_value) <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb25-5">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">collect</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>  id subset new_value
1  2      a        84
2  5      a        74
3 12      c        29
4 13      c        42
5 15      c         7</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>At some point in making this happen, data are loaded and computations are performed. At the user level we don’t really think about it much: the dplyr bindings supplied by the arrow package provide us with an abstraction layer for Datasets that completely mask this aspect of the process. That’s super cool because honestly I don’t care enough to spend my time on that sort of thing, but I also find myself curious… what happens when we strip the abstraction away? How would we do this analysis without these abstractions?</p>
<p>When querying a Dataset, we need a strategy for reading data: this is coordinated by a <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/Scanner.html">Scanner</a> object constructed for the specific Dataset and the specific query. When analyzing a Dataset using the dplyr interface you never need to construct a Scanner manually, but for explanatory purposes I’ll create one:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb27" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb27-1">scan <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> Scanner<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">create</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">dataset =</span> ds)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Calling the <code>ToTable()</code> method will materialise the Dataset (on-disk) as a Table (in-memory):<sup>13</sup></p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb28" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb28-1">scan<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">ToTable</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Table
15 rows x 3 columns
$id &lt;int32&gt;
$value &lt;double&gt;
$subset &lt;string&gt;

See $metadata for additional Schema metadata</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>You can see that this has returned 15 rows (i.e., the whole dataset). If we want to reproduce the behaviour of the dplyr pipeline using the low-level Dataset interface by creating a new scan by specifying the <code>filter</code> and <code>projection</code> arguments to <code>Scanner$create()</code>. The <code>filter</code> argument is used to modify the rows that are returned by the Scanner, and the <code>projection</code> argument is used to modify the columns. These arguments take <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/Expression.html">Arrow Expressions</a> as inputs, which is yet another topic I’ll try to write more about one of these days.</p>
<p>Anyway, the scanner defined below mimics the dplyr pipeline shown above,</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb30" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb30-1">scan <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> Scanner<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">create</span>(</span>

<span id="cb30-8">  )</span>
<span id="cb30-9">)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can check this by calling <code>scan$ToTable()</code> and then converting the result to a data frame so that we get a pretty print out:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb31" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb31-1">scan<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">ToTable</span>() <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">as.data.frame</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>  id subset new_value
1  2      a        84
2  5      a        74
3 12      c        29
4 13      c        42
5 15      c         7</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yep, that looks about right.</p>
<p>We can dig a little deeper though. To get a better sense of what happens when the query executes, what I’ll call <code>scan$ScanBatches()</code>. Much like the <code>ToTable()</code> method, the <code>ScanBatches()</code> method executes the query separately against each of the files, but it returns a list of Record Batches, one for each file. If we convert each one of those Record Batches to a data frame individually, we get this as a result:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb33" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb33-1">scan<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">ScanBatches</span>() <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">lapply</span>(as.data.frame)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[[1]]
  id subset new_value
1  2      a        84
2  5      a        74

[[2]]
[1] id        subset    new_value
&lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names)

[[3]]
  id subset new_value
1 12      c        29
2 13      c        42
3 15      c         7</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This version of the result helps you see each part of the Dataset at work in the query. When you pass a query to a Dataset, each file is processed in a separate thread<sup>14</sup> and Record Batches will be added as they are returned. The key point here is that Datasets have no notion of row order: if you want the results returned in a particular order you must sort them explicitly.</p>
<p>A second point to make about the the scanning process is that under the hood, Arrow keeps track of memory usage and doesn’t try to read too many files at once. It will also make use of whatever information it has about the file contents to avoid reading files that it doesn’t have to read: if I filter on <code>subset != "a"</code> then the Scanner will ensure that the files in the corresponding folder are never even read.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>Okay, so now let’s go back to the dplyr query we made earlier, but use <code>compute()</code> to return a Table rather use <code>collect()</code> to return a data frame.</p>
<div class="cell">

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-was-the-point">What was the point?</h2>
<p>Does any of this matter? Well. That depends, I suppose. If you’re looking to analyse a Dataset using R, you don’t really need to know much of this. Frankly you probably don’t need to know any of it. But also there’s something uncomfortable about using tools when you don’t quite know what they’re doing. It makes me happier when I know just a little bit more than I actually need to know. More importantly, it matters in the sense that it <em>works</em>. Using Datasets leads to shockingly fast performance on data that would not normally be amenable to analysis with R. Which… yeah, that does matter quite a bit!</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Unbelievably, there are people out there who will start talking about predicate pushdown and not even give a girl a heads up? Rude. You don’t see me starting conversations at the pub about metric axiom violations in human similarity judgment do you? Well, okay, you might. But that’s not the point!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Okay, <em>now</em> I’m a bit sorry.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Or indeed, “any”.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>For the purposes of this post we are going to pretend that Arrays behave like R vectors, which… they sort of do as long as you don’t try to push at the analogy too hard.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>The Schema is the way Arrow formalises the metadata for rectangular data structures. I’m not going to dive into the details here: it’s enough for our purposes to recognise that it’s basically a list of variable names and their data types.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>I mean, this is where you start asking all sort of questions about what objects are mutable in R anyway, since we’re almost never doing modify-in-place operations. But whatever. This is not the post for that, and if you try to make me talk about that here I will cry.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Again, let’s just pretend that a Chunked Array behaves just like an R vector, except for the fact that it has these weird stitches from where we’ve sewn the individual Arrays together. It’s all a bit vivisectionist in nature, sure, but this is the mechanism that allows Chunked Arrays to behave more like R vectors than simple Arrays do. Dr Frankenstein may not have been entirely wrong on all counts, I guess.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>It’s probably worth doing a tiny bit of foreshadowing here: there’s really no sense in which the files are “ordered”, right? So, logically it follows there’s no sense in which the Dataset as a whole has a total ordering of rows either, right? That’s worth keeping in mind because results don’t always come back in the same order unless you explicitly sort them. I’ll talk about this a little more later.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>The name comes from Apache Hive: <a href="https://hive.apache.org">hive.apache.org</a>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>One of these days I am going to write a proper blog post on parquet files for R users, I promise. I just don’t seem to have found the time yet. Not sure where all the time goes…↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>As usual there is esoteric knowledge buried in the C++ documentation, in this case describing <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/api/compute.html#_CPPv4N5arrow7compute19BackpressureControlE">backpressure control</a>. It’s probably ancient forbidden lore and Dumbledore is going to turn me into a hobbit or something but whatever.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>Strictly speaking I am assuming a FileSystemDataset and not a more esoteric kind of Dataset like an InMemoryDataset or a UnionDataset, and I am assuming that there is a one to one mapping between files and Fragments, but honestly those assumptions are usually true in everyday data analysis and if you know these distinctions already you certainly shouldn’t be using this post to learn about Datasets now should you? So the only reason you’d be bringing this up would be to correct me on the internet to show off how smart you are and that really would be just a dick move. Just saying.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>The scanning process is multi-threaded by default, but if necessary threading can be disabled by setting <code>use_threads = FALSE</code> when calling <code>Scanner$create()</code>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>Okay fine, yes you can set <code>use_threads = FALSE</code> like I said above to disable this, hush.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>For files formats like Parquet that include metadata for row groups and organise data column-wise, there are additional optimisations ensuring that you don’t have to read the whole file.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Notice that there is an empty chunk in there corresponding to the file that didn’t return any hits – that’s a deliberate act of seed hacking on my part! I rigged it so that one of the data subsets just happened to have all negative numbers. I wanted to highlight the fact that a scanned file that doesn’t return any rows will still return a Record Batch with zero rows, and this will still be reflected in any Table object that gets constructed. This doesn’t really matter for any practical purpose, but I think it helps get a feel for the mechanisms involved.↩︎</p></li>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p>Hello there fellow data science person. Have you heard rumours that a lot of folks from our community are moving to use mastodon for social networking? Are you curious, but maybe not quite sure about how to get started? Have you been thinking “twitter is a hellsite and I need to escape” a lot lately?</p>
<p>If yes, this post is for you!</p>
<p>It’s written from the time-tested pedagogical perspective of “the writer who is only one chapter ahead of her audience in the textbook”. I’ve been on mastodon for a few days, but this isn’t my first rodeo over there: I signed up for it very early on several years ago, and tried again a few years after that. This time I’m a lot more enthusiastic about it than the last two, so I’m writing a quick introductory post to help my fellow data science folks test out the waters. I sort of know what I’m doing there but not completely!</p>
<p>If you want a more detailed guide on navigating Mastodon and the fediverse, I recommend <a href="https://fedi.tips/">fedi.tips</a>. There’s a lot of answers to common questions over there, from someone who actually does know what they are doing! Alternatively you can read <a href="https://mastodon.nz/@explorergrace/109272759764872091">this thread</a> which covers a lot of the same things I’m saying here!</p>
<p>Okay, let’s dive in…</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-mastodon-what-is-the-fediverse">What is Mastodon? What is the fediverse?</h2>
<p>If you’re entirely new to this, your mental model of mastodon is probably something like “mastodon is an open source twitter clone”. To a first approximation that’s right, but if you want to really feel at home there you’re going to want to refine that mental model in a few ways. Mastodon is very similar to twitter in design, but there are some important differences</p>
<p>First off, mastodon is not a single application: it’s a distributed network of servers that all talk to each other using a shared protocol.<sup>1</sup> If two servers talk to each other they are said to be “federated” with one another, and the network as a whole is referred to as the “fediverse”.</p>
<p>There are many different servers out there that are independently running mastodon: these are called <strong>mastodon instances</strong>. You can sign up for an account at one or more of these servers. The most popular instance is <a href="https://mastodon.social/">mastodon.social</a>, but for reasons I’ll talk about in a moment this might not be the best choice for you! For example, my primary account is on <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon.org</a> and my art-only account is on an instance for generative artists, <a href="https://genart.social/">genart.social</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it usually doesn’t matter too much which instance you pick: the servers all communicate with each other so you can follow people on different servers, talk with them, etc, and it’s entirely possible to migrate your account from one server to another (I’ll talk about that later in the post). It’s only when you get into the details that it starts to matter!</p>
</section>
<section id="terminology-toots-and-boosts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="terminology-toots-and-boosts">Terminology: Toots and boosts</h2>
<p>Posts on twitter are called “tweets” and have a 280 character limit. Posts on mastodon are called “toots” and have a 500 character limit. If you’re thinking of making a joke about “haha it’s called tooting” well fine, but there’s a pretty good chance that everyone has already heard it. Very few of us are actually that original :-)</p>
<p>Sharing someone else’s post on twitter is called a “retweet”. The mastodon equivalent is called “boosting”. One deliberate design choice on mastodon is that there is no analog of “quote retweeting”: you can either boost someone else’s toot and you can post your own. You can’t share someone else’s post to your own followers with your commentary added. This is a <a href="https://fedi.tips/how-to-use-mastodon-and-the-fediverse-basic-tips/#WhyCantIQuoteOtherPostsInMastodon">deliberate design choice to prevent people from “dunking” on each other</a>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mastodon-handles-and-tags-look-like-email-addresses">Mastodon handles and tags look like email addresses</h2>
<p>On twitter, you simply have a username: I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/djnavarro">djnavarro</a> there, and people would tag me into a conversation by typing <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="djnavarro">@djnavarro</span></strong>.</p>
<p>On mastodon, you have to specify both your username and the server. It’s more like an email address. My primary handle on mastodon is <a href="[djnavarro@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@djnavarro)">djnavarro@fosstodon.org</a> and people can tag me into a conversation by typing <strong><span class="citation" data-cites="djnavarro">@djnavarro</span><span class="citation" data-cites="fosstodon.org">@fosstodon.org</span></strong>.</p>
<p>It looks a little odd when you’re used to twitter, but it gets easier.</p>

<section id="is-there-a-data-science-community-there" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-there-a-data-science-community-there">Is there a data science community there?</h2>
<p>Yes! There’s definitely a data science community there. It’s much smaller than the one on twitter and things tend to move at a slightly slower pace, but there are some advantages.</p>
<p>You can find your data science friends by searching for hashtags. R folks will quickly find other R users posting with the <strong>#rstats</strong> hashtag, but you can also find <strong>#TidyTuesday</strong> and other familiar hashtags. I’ll talk about this more later, but hashtags are much more useful (and more important) on mastodon than they are on twitter. The interface for hashtags is basically the same as twitter: you can search for them in the search box (see interface section below), hashtags are clickable links, etc.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found some people, you can find more by taking a look at who they follow and who follows them. Again, the interface for that is essentially the same as twitter: click on someone’s profile, and you’ll be able to find a list of people they follow and the people who follow them. However, what you will often finds is that these lists are incomplete: generally, the <em>follower counts</em> are accurate, but servers only publish the list of account names for accounts on that server.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Finally, when you’re ready to get started you can make an introduction post: all you have to do is send out a post tagged with <strong>#introduction</strong>. With any luck that will be picked up and shared with others!</p>

<section id="which-server-should-i-sign-up-on" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="which-server-should-i-sign-up-on">Which server should I sign up on?</h2>
<p>There’s a nicely <a href="https://fediscience.org/server-list.html">server list at fediscience.org</a> that has some commentaries. Here’s a few possibilities you might consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://mastodon.social">mastodon.social</a>: The largest instance. It’s general interest, so you get a reasonably diverse audience. However it’s also the focal point so any time there’s a wave of migrations from twitter it will probably be the first one to show performance hits.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://fosstodon.org">fosstodon.org</a>: An instance with a focus on open source software. There are a lot of tech people on this one, which means you can watch the local timeline scroll by (more on that coming!) and see lots of random techy posts.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://fediscience.org">fediscience.org</a>: A science focused instance, including natural and social sciences.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://vis.social">vis.social</a>: Lots of cool data visualisation folks here.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://tech.lgbt">tech.lgbt</a>: An instance for folks who work in tech, science, academia, etc who are LGBTIQ or allies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For any server, you should look carefully at the server rules that will be posted on the “About” page. Each server has different policies that will affect moderation. Don’t sign up for vis.social if you want to post about NFTs (I’ll talk about NFTs later actually), and don’t join fosstodon.org if you want to post in languages other than English. Don’t join any of these servers if you want to post anti-trans content.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Take a little time to look around but don’t worry about the choice too much. You can move your account across servers without too much difficulty if you need to, and I’ll show you how later in the post.</p>

<section id="can-you-tell-me-about-the-web-interface" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-you-tell-me-about-the-web-interface">Can you tell me about the web interface?</h2>
<p>Okay so you’ve decided on a server, signed up for an account, and are ready to get started. Let’s take a look at the interface!</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post I’ll assume you’re looking to get started by using the web interface. There are, unsurprisingly, apps you can download onto your phone (e.g., I’m using the standard mastodon app on iOS), but I’m trying not to complicate things in this post so let’s assume you’re using your laptop and are browsing through the web interface!</p>
<p>My main account is <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@djnavarro">djnavarro@fosstodon.org</a>. In my browser I’m logged in already, so when I navigate to <a href="https://fosstodon.org">fosstodon.org</a> I’m automatically shown the logged in view. There are two versions you can choose between, the “standard view” and the “advanced view”.</p>
<p>The “standard view” interface looks pretty similar to what you’d expect from twitter. On the left you can write posts, in the middle there’s a column where your feed is shown (I’ve edited these screenshots to remove the actual posts, just so we can focus on interface), and on the right sidebar there’s a menu with various options you can click on:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/img/standard_view.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>In a lot of cases this view will work well for you, but if you want to track hashtags – more on that later because hashtags are important! – you might find it useful to switch to the “advanced view”. To switch, click on the “Preferences” option on the right hand side, which brings up a preferences screen that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/img/appearance_settings.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Click on the “Enable advanced web interface” option, like I’ve done here, and click save changes. When you then go back to mastodon, the interface will have changed to one that looks very similar to the Tweetdeck interface that a lot of folks on Twitter use:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/img/advanced_view.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>There are more columns. As before, the left column shows an area where you can compose posts, and on the right column a menu with options is shown. Posts will appear in the “Home” column. Mentions, favourites (similar to Twitter “likes”), and boosts (similar to Twitter retweets), will be shown in the “Notifications” column.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-do-i-make-a-post" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-do-i-make-a-post">How do I make a post?</h2>
<p>Writing a post on mastodon is similar to how you would write a post on twitter. The compose window looks like this:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/img/compose.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:50.0%"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>You type the text you want into the box, adding hashtags, and then click the “Toot!” button (it may look different on your instance – I’ve seen the same button labelled “Post” sometimes). As you type, you’ll see the character count in the bottom right corner change to let you know how many characters you have left: you’re allowed 500 characters for a post on mastodon.</p>
<p>The nuances are important though. Those other buttons on the bottom left… those are all useful features. From left to right:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The paperclip button: clicking this will let you attach an image. When you do, there will be an option to edit the image and (especially important!) to add alt text for accessibility purposes. Mastodon has a stronger norm about alt text than twitter: <em>always</em> add alt text. I have a section on alt text later in this post.</p></li>
<li><p>The barchart button: this will let you add a poll. Polls on mastodon work similarly to twitter, but are a bit more flexible. You can add more options and let users select multiple options.</p></li>
<li><p>The world button: this will let you set the visibility for the post. If you click on it you will see four options: “public” means everyone can view it, “unlisted” means everyone can view it but it doesn’t get indexed by discovery features (very handy in replies and threads where you don’t want everyone to be automatically shown your comment), “followers only” means only your followers can see it, and “mentioned people only” means only the people mentioned can see it. This last one is effectively how direct messages work on mastodon, which is important to note because posts aren’t end-to-end encrypted. Do not treat your mastodon direct messages as private (see later).</p></li>
<li><p>The “CW” button: This is used to attach content warnings to your post. Use this button! It’s important. I cannot stress this enough: the content warning button is right there, and it is considered extremely poor form in the fediverse to force your followers to look at content they might not want to see. There is a whole section on this later, but remember that mastodon is not twitter – people will mute you or choose not to share your post if you don’t use content warnings appropriately. In fact, if you consistently boost posts that don’t have content warnings when they should, people may unfollow you also.</p></li>
<li><p>The “EN” button: This is used to specify the language in which the post is written. Clicking on it will show you a dropdown list you can use to select the language.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Try to use these features: it makes a difference!</p>

<section id="why-are-hashtags-so-important" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-are-hashtags-so-important">Why are hashtags so important?</h2>
<p>Hashtags play a much more important role on mastodon than they do on twitter. There’s no analog of the twitter algorithm scanning post content to determine what to show people. If you want your post to be discovered by people who aren’t following you (which, admittedly, isn’t always the case), make sure to choose the appropriate hashtags. As on twitter <strong>#rstats</strong> is used to specify that this is a post about R, there’s a <strong>#TidyTuesday</strong> tag used for Tidy Tuesday, etc. I post my generative art using <strong>#GenerativeArt</strong>, a general purpose generative art hashtag, and also <strong>#rtistry</strong> to specify that it’s art made with R. It’s generally considered fine – good, even! – to use several hashtags on mastodon. Tagging is your way of categorising posts for others to find…</p>
</section>
<section id="tracking-hashtags" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tracking-hashtags">Tracking hashtags</h2>
<p>Speaking of which, perhaps you want to monitor a hashtag. Maybe you even want to follow the hashtag, so that every post that has that hashtag will appear in your mastodon feed. Good news, you can!</p>
<p>From what I can tell, this is something where your options might be a little different on each server. For instance, on mastodon.social you can follow a hashtag directly in the standard view: when you search for a hashtag there will be a little “follow” icon that appears that you can click on (see <a href="https://fedi.tips/how-to-use-mastodon-and-the-fediverse-advanced-tips/#FollowingHashtags">this comment on fedi.tips</a>). When you do that, posts with that hashtag will appear in your feed. However, not every server implements this: fosstodon.org doesn’t do that right now.</p>
<p>So let’s go with a method that seems to work everywhere I’ve looked. This <a href="https://mastodon.nz/@thoughtfulnz/109278289508807509">post by David Hood</a> summarises it in a single image, but I’ll go through it more slowly here…</p>
<p>First off, you’ll need to be in “advanced view” to do this. That’s the one with lots of columns that I showed earlier in the post. You can customise this view by adding columns that correspond to the hashtags you want to follow. For example, let’s say I want to follow the <strong>#rstats</strong> hashtag. The first thing I’d do is type <strong>#rstats</strong> into the search bar (in the top left corner). The results will be shown directly below the search bar, like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/img/searching_hashtag.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>These are clickable links. When I click on the <strong>#rstats</strong> hashtag in the results, a new column appears… containing a chronological feed that consists of posts tagged with <strong>#rstats</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/img/rstats_column.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Again, in real life this won’t be empty: you’ll actually see the posts! You are now tracking <strong>#rstats</strong> on mastodon, albeit temporarily.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to make sure the column sticks around every time you open mastodon. We can “pin” the column in place. To do that, I click on the little “settings” icon at the top right of the <strong>#rstats</strong> column. It’s the one on the far right here:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/img/rstats_column_menu.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:50.0%"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>When you do that, you will see a small menu that gives you the option to pin! Easy.</p>
<p>We can make our <strong>#rstats</strong> column more useful. For example, there are several hashtags I want to bundle together when following R content: <strong>#TidyTuesday</strong>, <strong>#TidyModels</strong>, and <strong>#ggplot2</strong>. I don’t want a separate column for each one, I want to group them into a single feed. Click on that little settings button again. Now you’ll see a richer menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/img/add_hashtags.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>One of the options there is “include additional tags”. When I click on that, I can type in the other hashtags to track:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/img/multitag.png" class="img-fluid"> And now we are done! I have a feed that tracks R related content on mastodon.</p>
</section>
<section id="why-are-content-warnings-everywhere" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-are-content-warnings-everywhere">Why are content warnings everywhere?</h2>
<p>One huge – and hugely important – difference between twitter and mastodon is that mastodon has a system that allows users to mask their posts behind content warnings. Now… if you’re coming from twitter you might be thinking “oh that doesn’t apply to me I don’t post offensive content”.</p>
<p>If that’s what you’re thinking, allow me to disabuse you of that notion quickly. Content warnings are not about “hiding offensive content”, they are about being kind to your audience. This <a href="https://robot.rodeo/@mike/109270985467672999">thread by Mike McHargue</a> is a very good summary. The whole thread is good, but I’ll quote the first part here:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If you’re part of the <strong>#twittermigration</strong>, it may seem strange the people use CWs so much here. But, CWs are really helpful. So much of our world is overwhelming, and feed presentation can bombard our nervous systems with triggers. CWs give people time and space to engage with that they have the resources to engage with. It gives them agency. I follow news and politics AND it’s helpful for my PTSD to have the chance to take a deep breath <em>before</em> I see a post.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re posting about politics, that should be hidden behind a content warning. If you’re posting about sexual assault, definitely use a content warning. If you’re posting about trans rights, again put it behind a content warning.</p>
<p>You should use the content warning even – or perhaps especially – when you think your post is this is an important social justice issue that other people <em>need</em> to see, because there is a really good chance that people whose lives are affected by it will be part of the audience… and yes, some of us have PTSD.</p>
<div class="callout-warning callout callout-style-default callout-captioned">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target=".callout-1-contents" aria-controls="callout-1" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle callout">

<div class="callout-caption-container flex-fill">

</div>
<div id="callout-1" class="callout-1-contents callout-collapse collapse">
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>I’ll give examples relevant to my own experience.</p>
<p>I get really, really angry when people post about trans rights without a content warning. Same with sexual assault. Why? Well, because I am transgender and I am frightened about the general direction the world is headed for people like me. I am not an activist and I don’t have the kind of resilience needed to constantly hear all the worst stories in the world about attacks against people like me. It’s one of the big reasons I left twitter: twitter algorithms prioritise engagement, and I cannot help but engage with this content because I am afraid. My experience on twitter is one of emotional abuse: twitter keeps showing me my worst fears and I click on them because the threats are real. I don’t appreciate it when my friends try to support me by <em>forcing me to see even more of that content</em>. For that reason, if you want to be supportive of people like me, use a content warning when posting about trans rights.</p>
<p>An even more extreme example relevant to my personal experience is sexual assault. I am a rape survivor. Every time there is a highly visible discussion about sexual assault (e.g., the Brett Kavanaugh hearings in the US, the Brittney Higgins discussions in Australia), I would get bombarded with content about rape. Over and over again. Sometimes it would trigger panic attacks and rape flashbacks.</p>
<p>When you post those things without providing me a content warning to help me make an informed choice, what you’re really telling me is that you simply don’t care if you’re forcing me to relive the experience of being raped.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So if you’re thinking about posting about these topics, the question of “should I attach a content warning?” isn’t a matter of “is this important?” it’s a matter of “could I be causing distress to people?” When you answer that question, don’t think about the typical case, think about that 1% of people who might be most severely affected and the reasons why.</p>
<p>Please, please, please… take content warnings seriously. Even if you’re “just posting about politics” or “venting some feelings”. It’s a kindness and courtesy to your audience.</p>
<p>Mastodon isn’t twitter.</p>

<p>Hopefully the previous section has convinced you that you should use content warnings and err on the side of caution when deciding when to use them. Your next question is probably: how do I add a content warning?</p>
<p>Luckily, it is super easy. It’s so simple that it fits into a single toot, like <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@Em0nM4stodon/109282181601490676">this post by Em on infosec.exchange</a>. Here’s how.</p>
<ol type="1">

</figure>
</div></li>
<li><p>Write a brief but informative message in that title field. This could be something very serious like “Sexual assault discussion”, but it could also be something mild like “Spoiler alert: The Good Wife season 5” or something like “Photo with direct eye contact”. Even things like “US politics” or “Australian politics” can be helpful.</p></li>
<li><p>Write your post. (Okay you could write the post first and the content warning text after. Whatever)</p></li>
<li><p>When you post it, other users will only be shown the title field at first. If they decide they want to read, they can click on the post, and then the full text will be revealed.</p></li>
<li><p>Profit! Everybody is happy.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Content warnings are good for everybody.</p>

<section id="how-can-i-make-threads" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-can-i-make-threads">How can I make threads?</h2>
<p>Making threads on mastodon is pretty similar to twitter. Just post each new toot as a reply to the previous one. Problem solved!</p>
<p>There is one subtlety to be aware of though, which is described in this <a href="https://scicomm.xyz/@quokka/109274732847484553">thread by Quokka on scicomm.xyz</a>. Remember earlier I mentioned that you can set the visibility of each post? The polite way to do a thread is set the <em>first</em> post to “public”, and then all the later ones to <em>unlisted</em>. The reason for that is that all public posts (including replies) will show up in various timelines. Usually, that’s not what you want. What you want is something where the first post reads “I have this important and exciting thing to to talk about: A thread…”, and only that first post shows up on people’s timelines. Then if they’re interested they can click on the first post and the rest of the thread will be revealed. That’s why people on mastodon usually set the first post to public and the later ones to unlisted.</p>
</section>
<section id="mastodon-favourites-vs-twitter-likes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mastodon-favourites-vs-twitter-likes">Mastodon favourites vs twitter likes</h2>
<p>Mastodon favourites (the little star under each toot) are very similar to twitter likes (the loveheart under each tweet). They aren’t identical though. The big difference is that mastodon implementation is far, far better and not deceptive.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>On twitter, we’ve all become accustomed to the obnoxious fact that “likes” do two different things: they send a signal to the person that you liked what they said (i.e., what they’re supposed to do!), but whenever you do that it will trigger a “stochastic retweet”: some proportion of people who follow you will also see that tweet because you liked it. This is annoying because very often you actually enjoy a thing but don’t think it is appropriate to retweet.</p>
<p>This bothers me because it seems to me that twitter doesn’t respect your boundaries. The fact that I like something is not an act in which I give twitter permission to share that fact to other people. I think it’s abusive behaviour by twitter.</p>
<p>Happily, mastodon doesn’t do anything like that. Favourites don’t trigger anything. They do <em>exactly</em> the thing they claim to do: they are a mechanism by which you can communicate to the other person “hey I liked this!” So you should use favourites a lot! Show people you appreciate them!</p>
<p>Quite separate from that, if you think this is something your followers would appreciate seeing, then boost it too! The key thing is that on mastodon the two functions are separated cleanly… do both when both are appropriate, do one when one is appropriate. You are in control of your sharing behaviour here.</p>

<section id="what-are-the-local-and-federated-timelines" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-the-local-and-federated-timelines">What are the local and federated timelines?</h2>
<p>At some point on mastodon you will find yourself discovering the local timeline and the federated timeline. There are links to these on the right hand side of the interface. The local timeline is every public-visibility post on your server, shown chronologically. This timeline has a very different feel on different servers. On <a href="https://fosstodon.org/">fosstodon.org</a> my local timeline has a lot of people posting about tech; on <a href="https://genart.social/">genart.social</a> it shows a lot of generative art.</p>
<p>The federated timeline is slightly different: it shows all public posts from all users who are “known” to your instance. That is, it includes every user on your instance, but it also includes everyone that users on your instance follow – even if those users are on other servers. It’s not the same thing as “every user on mastodon” though. People on <a href="https://genart.social/">genart.social</a> tend to follow other artists, so there is still a local “flavour” to the posts from outside the instance: they reflect people and topics that the users on your instance are interested in.</p>
<p>These timelines are useful for discovery purposes, and they’re also a reason to think carefully about the instance you’re on. It’s easier to find tech content on a tech-focused server!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-do-i-move-my-account-to-a-new-server">How do I move my account to a new server?</h2>
<p>So that brings me naturally to a question… what if you realise you’ve made a mistake and you want to change instances? This happens to many of us at one point or another. For instance, I initially signed up as <strong>djnavarro@mastodon.social</strong>. That wasn’t ideal for me: the server is a bit too big, it was being very slow at the time, and the content isn’t focused on things I wanted to see. So I decided I wanted to move, and become <strong>djnavarro@fosstodon.org</strong>.</p>
<p>A very nice feature of mastodon is that you can “migrate” your account, so that when you switch accounts all your followers will come along for the ride! Here’s how you do it:</p>

<li>It’s probably a good idea to post from your old account that you’re about to initiate a move. That way people will not be surprised when they find themselves following a new account (I didn’t do this… I should have. Oops!)</li>
<li>Set up your account, with the avatar, bio, etc on the new account using the same (or similar) images and descriptions on the old account: anyone who clicks through on the new account will see that it’s you!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 2: Export your follows from the old account</strong></p>
<p>When you migrate, it takes your followers across automatically. It doesn’t automatically make your new account follow everyone you were following on the old account. Luckily you don’t have to manually re-follow everyone. Instead, you export a csv file with the list of everyone you’re following at the old account, and later on you can import it as a follow list on the new one. Here’s how we export the csv at the old account:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the “preferences” option</li>
<li>Within preferences, select “import and export”</li>
<li>On the data export page, you’ll see a list of possible csv files you can download. Download the ones you want, especially the “follows” csv.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Step 3: Set up alias on the new account</strong></p>
<p>Mastodon requires both accounts to authorise the move in some fashion, to prevent anyone from trying to steal other people’s accounts. First, your new account needs to signal that yes, it does wish to be an “alias” for your old account. From the new account – <strong>djnavarro@fosstodon.org</strong> for me – we need to set that up:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the “preferences” options</li>
<li>Within preferences, select “account”</li>
<li>On the account settings page, scroll down to the bottom to the section called “moving from a different account” and click on the link “create an account alias”</li>
<li>On the account aliases page, specify the handle of your old account – e.g., <strong>djnavarro@mastodon.social</strong> in my case – and click “create alias”</li>
</ol>
<p>You’re done: the alias is set up. You may have to wait a while for this to propagate to the old account. When I moved I had to wait overnight because mastodon.social was running very slowly due to the massive spike of new users from twitter. Hopefully it won’t be that long for most people now.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Initiate the move from the old account</strong></p>
<p>With the new account now signalling that it is ready to be an alias for the old one, we can authorise the move from the old account. On the old account (i.e., <strong>djnavarro@mastodon.social</strong> for me) do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the “preferences” options</li>
<li>Within preferences, select “account”</li>
<li>On the account settings page, scroll down to the bottom to the section called “moving to a different account” and click on the link “configure it here”</li>
<li>On the moving accounts page, type the handle of the new account – in my case <strong>djnavarro@fosstodon.org</strong> – and enter the password for your old account to confirm. Click “move followers”.</li>
</ol>
<p>This will initiate the move. All your followers at the old account will automatically unfollow the old account and then follow the new one. It’ll take a little while and it might happen in bursts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Import your follows at the new account</strong></p>
<p>The last step (optionally) is to have your new account re-follow everyone from that you were following at the old account. We can do that using the csv that you downloaded in step 2. So, again from your new account:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Click on the “preferences” options</li>
<li>Within preferences, select “import and export”</li>
<li>On the menu on the left, click the “import” submenu</li>
<li>On the import screen, select the import type (e.g., “following list”), click on “browse” to select the csv file you exported earlier, and then click “upload”.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your new account will now automatically follow all the accounts your old account followed.</p>
<p>With any luck, you are now successfully moved into your new account!</p>

<section id="etiquette-on-alt-text" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="etiquette-on-alt-text">Etiquette on alt-text?</h2>
<p>On twitter, you’ve probably found that there’s some pressure and expectation to supply alt-text for your images. The norm is <a href="https://mastodon.art/@Curator/109279035107793247">much stronger on mastodon</a>: people will expect that images have alt-text, and that the alt-text be informative. Here’s a walkthrough. First I might start writing a post, and after clicking on the paperclip icon to attach an image, I have a screen that looks like this:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/img/image_post_started.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" style="width:50.0%"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>As usual I’d write the content of my post in the composer box, but I would also click on the “edit” link in the top-right hand corner of my image. That brings up the image editing screen that looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-11-03_what-i-know-about-mastodon/img/image_editing.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>There are two things I usually do with this. On the right hand side I can drag and drop the focus circle around to help improve the image preview that gets shown to users. More importantly, on the left hand side I can write my alt-text. For some images it’s easy to come up with a good description, for others it is hard. For something like this one I’d usually aim to write a short paragraph that captures this information:</p>
<ul>
<li>this is generative art made with R</li>
<li>the title of the piece is “Gods of Salt, Stone, and Storm”</li>
<li>the palette is blue/green with a hint of white against a very dark background</li>
<li>the image is comprised of swirling patterns throughout</li>
<li>the overall impression is something akin to dark storm clouds overhead or maybe unsettled seas</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not a perfect description, but it does capture what I think is important about the artwork.</p>
</section>
<section id="etiquette-on-nfts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="etiquette-on-nfts">Etiquette on NFTs?</h2>
<p>A lot of artists on twitter, especially generative artists, like to post NFTs. It’s understandable: for generative artists, it’s the one reliable income stream they have for their art. However, you need to be very, very careful. NFTs are not well liked on the fediverse, and a lot of servers have outright bans on any form of NFT posting. For instance, you cannot post about NFTs at all on <a href="https://vis.social">vis.social</a> or <a href="https://mastodon.art">mastodon.art</a>. It is written into the server rules, so you should not sign up on those servers if that’s something you’re interested in. However, even on servers that do permit NFTs, there is often a strong suggestion that you should be polite and respect the preferences that folks outside the instance will have. For example, the generative art instance I’m on <a href="https://genart.social">genart.social</a> does not impose an outright ban on NFTs but it is discouraged, and in the rare instance that you do post NFT content, it must be behind a content warning.</p>
<p>Personally I’ve stopped even trying to make money from my art, so it doesn’t affect me: I’ve given up. I’m only bothering to mention it here because I don’t want to see generative art folks run afoul of the local norms.</p>
</section>
<section id="etiquette-on-cross-posting-from-twitter" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="etiquette-on-cross-posting-from-twitter">Etiquette on cross-posting from twitter?</h2>
<p>Cross-posting from twitter is another one where you have to be careful. There are tools that will let you automatically repost from one to the other, but it’s worth thinking about this from a social perspective rather than a technical one. What will people on mastodon start thinking when your mastodon feed is just a long series of posts where you’re responding to something on twitter, or retweeting something on twitter? What will they conclude when they try to reply to you and you don’t respond because you were on twitter, not mastodon? Probably what will happen is people will realise you’re not actually on mastodon at all and unfollow you. I’ve done this a few times already. I’m trying to leave twitter for a reason, and it irritates me when people who are ostensibly (but not really) on mastodon keep trying to direct me to content on there.</p>
</section>
<section id="etiquette-on-bots-and-automated-accounts" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="etiquette-on-bots-and-automated-accounts">Etiquette on bots and automated accounts?</h2>
<p>Bots are allowed on mastodon, but you should check the local server rules and you should make certain that the bot is marked as an automated account in the account preferences.</p>
</section>
<section id="direct-messages-and-privacy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="direct-messages-and-privacy">Direct messages and privacy</h2>
<p>As a final point, a note on direct messages. Direct messages on mastodon are just regular posts whose visibility is set to include only those people tagged in that post. That’s all. This is important to recognise because – at present – posts are not transmitted with end-to-end encryption: they are “private” only in the sense that a postcard is private or an unencrypted email is private. They won’t be broadcast to anyone else, but they aren’t secured while in transit.</p>
<p>You should never send any sensitive information via mastodon.</p>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p>This is a post about Arrow Flight. I will probably tell a whimsical anecdote to open this post. Or not. Who knows. Maybe I’ll leave the introductory paragraph like this. That would be pretty on-brand for me actually.</p>
<p><br></p>
<section id="the-what-and-why-of-arrow-flight" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-what-and-why-of-arrow-flight">The what and why of Arrow Flight</h2>
<p>The central idea behind flight is deceptively simple: it provides a standard protocol for transferring Arrow data over a network. But to understand why this is a Big Deal, you need to have a good sense of what the Arrow ecosystem is all about. For that, I found it helpful to go all the way back<sup>1</sup> to the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/10/13/introducing-arrow-flight/">original announcement of flight by Wes McKinney</a>. Here’s how he explained the motivation:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Our design goal for Flight is to create a new protocol for data services that uses the Arrow columnar format as both the over-the-wire data representation as well as the public API presented to developers. In doing so, we reduce or remove the serialization costs associated with data transport and increase the overall efficiency of distributed data systems. Additionally, two systems that are already using Apache Arrow for other purposes can communicate data to each other with extreme efficiency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put this in context, it helps to have a little recap of how the project has grown: Arrow was originally introduced to provide an efficient and language-agnostic <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html">standard for representing tabular data in-memory</a>, but as the project has grown it has necessarily expanded in scope. For example, storing data in-memory is not entirely useful if you can’t manipulate it, so Arrow now supplies a powerful <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/compute.html">compute engine</a> that underpins both the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/index.html">arrow package in R</a> and the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html">pyarrow library in Python</a>, and several others besides. In other words, the compute engine has been developed to solve a practical data science problem.</p>
<p>Arrow Flight evolved from a similar practical concern. It’s pretty trivial to point out that we live in a networked world now, and as consequence it is hard to avoid situations where the data to be analysed are stored on a different machine than the one that does the analysis. In my earlier posts on <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-09-09_reticulated-arrow/">reticulate</a> and <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-09-16_arrow-and-rpy2/">rpy2</a> I talked about how to efficiently share an Arrow data set between <em>languages</em>, but I implicitly assumed in those posts that the R process and the Python process were running on the same <em>machine</em>. The moment we have processes running on different machines, those tricks don’t work anymore!</p>
<p>Flight is designed to solve this problem. It’s not a fancypants protocol with lots of different parts. It exists for one purpose: it makes it super easy to transfer Arrow-formatted data. That’s it. It’s pretty flexible though, and you can build other stuff on top of flight, but the design of flight is deliberately simple. It’s <em>meant</em> to be pretty minimal, so you can “just use it” without having to think too hard or do any of the obnoxious implementation work yourself.</p>

<section id="prerequisites" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>There are a couple of prerequisites for this post. Specifically I’ll assume you have the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/">arrow</a> and <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/">reticulate</a> packages installed in your R environment, and similarly that your Python environment has <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html">pyarrow</a> installed. If you’re only interested in the Python side, you probably don’t need either of the R packages, but R users will need to have the pyarrow installation because the R flight implementation builds on pyarrow.</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="an-r-example" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="an-r-example">An R example</h2>
<p>The implementation of Arrow Flight varies a little across languages. In this post I’m going to focus on the two languages I use most – R and Python – but there’s nothing stopping you from using other languages. For example, the book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/in-memory-analytics-with-apache-arrow/9781801071031">In-Memory Analytics with Apache Arrow</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/zeroshade">Matt Topol</a> has worked examples using C++ and Go, in addition to Python.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post I’m going to start with R because the arrow package in R exposes a “high-level” interface that will allow us to start using a flight server without having to dive deeply into how it all works. However, as we’ll see, there are some limitations to this approach – not least of which is the fact that the R implementation turns out to secretly be a Python implementation under the hood – and as the post progresses I’ll pivot to Python in order to unpack some of the lower-level functionality.</p>
<p>To do this I’ll need access to the arrow and reticulate packages, and I’ll need to make certain that the Python environment is one that has pyarrow installed. For my machine, the commands to do this look like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">library</span>(arrow)</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">library</span>(reticulate)</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">use_miniconda</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"base"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>It may be a little different for you depending on your configuration. For more information on this, take a look at the <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-09-09_reticulated-arrow/">reticulate post</a> I wrote recently.</p>
<p><br></p>
<section id="the-flight-server" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-flight-server">The flight server</h3>
<p>Okay, so let’s get started by thinking about the simplest possible scenario for using a flight server. In this set up all we want the server to do is to act as a “cache” for Arrow tables. Clients can upload tables to the server, download tables from the server, and so on. That’s all we’re really trying to accomplish, and happily for us this use case is supported out of the box in R.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. As I mentioned earlier, R doesn’t actually implement the flight protocol itself: it’s just a wrapper around the Python tools. What that means is the underlying flight server is actually written in Python, and if we want to start that server running from R we have to call the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/load_flight_server.html"><code>load_flight_server()</code></a> function that will allow us access to this server from R. Conveniently, the arrow R package comes bundled with a “demo” server that already provides the server side functionality that we want, and I can import it like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1">server_class <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">load_flight_server</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"demo_flight_server"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>When I do this, all I’ve done is obtain access to the relevant Python code. I haven’t created a server yet and I haven’t started it running either. Create an instance of the “demo server”, I call the <code>DemoFlightServer()</code> method attached to the <code>server_class</code> object:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1">server <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> server_class<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">DemoFlightServer</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">port =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">8089</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>We have now defined a server that, once started, will run on port 8089. The <code>server</code> object has a <code>serve()</code> method that I can call to start it running:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1">server<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">serve</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>I’ve written a short script called <a href="./start_demo_server.R">start_demo_server.R</a> that bundles all these operations together:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>start_demo_server.R</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" data-startfrom="3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource r numberLines number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r" style="counter-reset: source-line 2;"><span id="cb5-3"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;"># load R packages and specify the Python environment</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">library</span>(arrow)</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">library</span>(reticulate)</span>
<span id="cb5-6"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">use_miniconda</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"base"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb5-7"></span>
<span id="cb5-8"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;"># load server class, create instance, start serving</span></span>
<span id="cb5-9">server_class <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">load_flight_server</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"demo_flight_server"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb5-10">server <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> server_class<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">DemoFlightServer</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">port =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">8089</span>)</span>
<span id="cb5-11">server<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">serve</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The easiest way to start a server running in its very own R process would be to execute this script – or a suitably modified version that refers to an appropriate Python environment and server port – at the terminal, which I could do like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">Rscript</span> start_demo_server.R <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">&amp;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This would start an R process as a background job that creates a server and start it running. As an alternative, if you’re comfortable with using the <a href="https://callr.r-lib.org/">callr</a> package, you can use <code>callr::r_bg()</code> to create a child R process from your current one. The child process will run in the background, and we can start start the server within that R session without blocking the current one. This code will do exactly that:</p>
<div class="cell">

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-flight-client">The flight client</h3>
<p>Now that I have this server running, I’ll define a flight client in my current R session that can interact with it. To do that, I call <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/flight_connect.html"><code>flight_connect()</code></a>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1">client <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">flight_connect</span>(<span class="at" style="color: #657422;">port =</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">8089</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the R object <code>client</code> is a wrapper around a Python flight client. It comes with various methods that implement low-level flight operations, but I’m going to hold off talking about those for a moment because we won’t need to use the low-level interface in this initial example.</p>
<p>Let’s start by using the client to ask a simple question: what is stored on the server? The way that data sources are conceptualised in Arrow Flight is as a set of “flights”. Each individual “flight” is a data stream from which the client can download data. The precise implementation of this idea (e.g., what data structures are stored in a single flight) varies from server to server, but in both examples in this post one flight corresponds to one Arrow table.</p>
<p>To find out what flights are currently available on our server, we can call the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/list_flights.html"><code>list_flights()</code></a> function:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb9" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb9-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">list_flights</span>(client)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>list()</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hm, okay, there’s nothing there. That makes sense because I haven’t actually uploaded anything to the server yet! Okay, well, let’s suppose I want to store a copy of the <code>airquality</code> data as an Arrow table on my server. As R users are probably aware, this is a data set that comes bundled with R, but just so we’re all on the same page here’s the first few rows of the data set:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb11" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb11-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">head</span>(airquality)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>  Ozone Solar.R Wind Temp Month Day
1    41     190  7.4   67     5   1
2    36     118  8.0   72     5   2
3    12     149 12.6   74     5   3
4    18     313 11.5   62     5   4
5    NA      NA 14.3   56     5   5
6    28      NA 14.9   66     5   6</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This object is a regular data frame in R: it’s not an Arrow table. Strictly speaking what we want our client to do is send the Arrow table version of this data set to the server, so it will need to be converted. Happily for us, the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/flight_put.html"><code>flight_put()</code></a> function supplied by the arrow package takes care of that conversion for us. As a result, we can cache an Arrow table copy of the data on the server with one line of code:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb13" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb13-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">flight_put</span>(client, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">data =</span> airquality, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">path =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"pollution_data"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this code, the <code>flight_put()</code> function uses the <code>client</code> object to communicate with the server. The <code>data</code> argument specifies the local copy of the data set, and the <code>path</code> argument provides the name for the data on the server. Having uploaded the data we can once again call <code>list_flights()</code>, and we get this as the result:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb14" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb14-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">list_flights</span>(client)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] "pollution_data"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Now, just to prove to you that I’m not cheating, let’s check to make sure that there is no object called <code>pollution_data</code> stored locally within my R session:<sup>2</sup></p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb16" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb16-1">pollution_data</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-error">
<pre><code>Error in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'pollution_data' not found</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there is no object called <code>pollution_data</code> available in my current R session. The <code>pollution_data</code> object is stored on the server, not the client. To access that data from the client I can use the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/flight_get.html"><code>flight_get()</code></a> function:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb18" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb18-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">flight_get</span>(client, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"pollution_data"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Table

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unpacking-the-data-exchange-process">Unpacking the data exchange process</h2>
<p>The example in the last section is a nice proof-of-concept. It shows that we can use R to start a flight server and use it to upload and download data. But there’s a lot that hasn’t really been explained properly here. The time has come to start digging a little deeper, so we can really get a sense of what’s going on under the hood and how this simple example can be extended. That’s our goal in this section.</p>
<p>One thing that I like about the flight functionality exposed through <code>flight_connect()</code>, <code>flight_put()</code>, <code>flight_get()</code>, etc is that it operates at a high level of abstraction. In my day-to-day data analysis work I really don’t want to spend my time thinking about low-level operations. When I tell R to “put” a data set onto the server I want this to happen with one line of code. This high level API is super useful to me on an everyday basis, but it also masks some of the details about how flight works.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of what’s being hidden, we can take a closer look at the <code>client</code> object. Here’s a list of some of the methods that are available through the object itself:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb20-1">client<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">do_put</span>()</span>
<span id="cb20-2">client<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">do_get</span>()</span>
<span id="cb20-3">client<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">do_action</span>()</span>
<span id="cb20-4">client<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">list_action</span>()</span>
<span id="cb20-5">client<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">list_flights</span>()</span>
<span id="cb20-6">client<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">get_flight_info</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Each of these methods describes a low level operation available to the flight client. More precisely, these are the actual methods prescribed by the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html">Arrow Flight protocol</a>. Moreover, although I’m showing you this as an R object, in truth these are all Python methods: the R implementation of Arrow Flight is essentially a wrapper around the Python implementation. We can access these methods from R thanks to the magic of <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/">reticulate</a>, but – to foreshadow the pivot coming in the next section – eventually we will need to start working with the underlying Python code.</p>
<p>When we look at the names of flight methods, we can see there’s (unsurprisingly) a relationship between those names and the names of the functions exposed in the high-level R interface. As you might expect, the <code>do_put()</code> method for the client is very closely related to the <code>flight_put()</code> function. However, they aren’t the same. The <code>do_put()</code> method doesn’t stream any data to the server: it merely opens a connection to the server, from which we can then stream data with subsequent commands. If calling the <code>do_put()</code> method directly, you would have to take care of the streaming yourself.<sup>3</sup> But from the user perspective it’s tiresome to write that code over and over, so the <code>flight_put()</code> function in the R interface provides a convenient high-level wrapper that abstracts over all that.</p>
<p>If you’re the analyst working with the data, this is fabulous. But if you’re looking to implement your very own flight server, you probably need to understand what these low level operations are. So that’s where we’re headed next…</p>
<p><br></p>
<section id="unpacking-flight_put" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unpacking-flight_put">Unpacking flight_put()</h3>
<p>Let’s start by taking a look at what happens when we call the R function <code>flight_put()</code>. For now, we won’t write any actual code (don’t worry, that will come later!). All we want to do is think about the sequence of operations that takes place. Our goal is to transmit the data to the server, and there’s an Arrow Flight method called <code>do_put()</code> that can do this for us. However, the structure of the interaction is a little more complicated than simply calling <code>do_put()</code>. It’s a multi-step operation that unfolds as shown below:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-10-18_arrow-flight/img/do_put.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The first step in the process occurs when the client calls <code>do_put()</code>, a flight method that takes two arguments: a <strong>flight descriptor</strong> object that is used to identify the specific data stream that the client wants to be sent – and later on I’ll talk what the descriptor actually looks like – and the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/Schema.html">schema</a> for the flight data.<sup>4</sup> Setting aside the particulars of the syntax – which might be different in every language – here’s what the <code>do_put()</code> function call looks like on the client side:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb21-1">do_put(descriptor, schema)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Passing the schema on the client side serves a particular purpose: it allows the client to create <strong>stream writer</strong> and <strong>stream reader</strong> objects that are returned to the client-side user, and are also passed along to the server. The writer object is the thing that will take care of streaming data to the server, and the reader object is responsible for reading any metadata response that the server happens to send.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Now let’s have a look at the server side, where the <code>do_put()</code> method expects three inputs: the flight descriptor, the writer, and the reader. So here’s the signature on the server side:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb22-1">do_put(descriptor, reader, writer)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As long as these methods are written appropriately for both the client and the server, we now have a situation where both machines agree on the description of the data and have objects that can take care of the streaming process.</p>
<p>We now move to step two in the communication, in which the client streams the data to the server. Once the data arrive on the server side, the <code>do_put()</code> method for the server stores the data along with an appropriate descriptor, so that it can be found later. Optionally, this is followed by a third stage in which the server sends a response containing metadata to the client. In the example server I’ll build in the next section, I won’t bother with that step!</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="unpacking-flight_get" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unpacking-flight_get">Unpacking flight_get()</h3>
<p>Next let’s look at <code>flight_get()</code>. When I called this function earlier, it triggered two separate interactions between the client and server. First, the client calls the <code>get_flight_info()</code> method, and the server responds with some information about the data source that includes – among other things – a <strong>ticket</strong>. Again, the ticket is a particular data structure that I’ll talk more about later, but for now it’s enough to note that it’s a token that uniquely specifies which flight is requested.</p>
<p>Once in possession of this ticket, the client can call <code>do_get()</code> to request that the server send the data that matches the ticket, which the server then streams. So the whole exchange looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-10-18_arrow-flight/img/do_get.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>So, in the previous example when I called <code>flight_get()</code>, the process looked like this. On the client side, we used the <code>"pollution_data"</code> path to construct a descriptor object and the client used <code>get_flight_info()</code> to request that information about this “flight” from the server:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb23" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb23-1">get_flight_info(descriptor)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>On the server side, once the descriptor is received, a <strong>flight info</strong> object is constructed. The flight info object is comprised of five parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The schema for the data stored by the flight,</li>
<li>The flight descriptor object</li>
<li>A list of one or more endpoints that specify where the data are available for streaming. Each end point includes a location from which to stream, and the associated ticket for that location</li>
<li>The total number of records (i.e.&nbsp;rows) stored</li>
<li>The total number of bytes to be streamed (i.e., the size of the data)</li>
</ul>
<p>This flight info is then returned to the client.</p>
<p>It may seem like this arrangement is overly elaborate: why does the client need this much information if only the ticket is needed to request the data? To be honest, for the simple server-client examples I’ve used in this post, this level of complexity is not really needed. However, it’s extremely useful that it’s structured like this when we want to start adopting a more sophisticated setup. One thing it allows, for example, is an arrangement where both the server and client can be distributed across multiple machines, with different endpoints streaming different subsets of the data. Matt Topol discusses some examples where this architecture is employed in <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/in-memory-analytics-with-apache-arrow/9781801071031">In-Memory Analytics with Apache Arrow</a>.</p>
<p>Once this flight information has been received by the client, we can extract the ticket from the relevant endpoint (there will be only one endpoint in the server I build in the next section). The client now calls:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb24" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb24-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">do_get</span>(ticket)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The server then sends a <strong>stream reader</strong> object that the client can use to receive the stream of data from the server.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-python-example">A Python example</h2>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of what is happening at a lower level, we can build a flight server of our very own. To do this I’ll switch over to Python. There’s two reasons for doing this. The first reason is that R doesn’t currently have a low level implementation of flight: at the moment it relies on the Python implementation, so it’s easiest to switch completely to Python for the rest of this post.<sup>6</sup> The second reason is that Python doesn’t supply a high level API analogous to <code>flight_put()</code>, <code>flight_get()</code> etc, and instead adheres tightly to the Arrow Flight specification. That’s super helpful if you need to design a custom flight server because you get access to the all Arrow Flight functionality, but it also means you need to write a lot more code. To help make that process a little easier, I’ll walk you through how that works in Python now!</p>
<p><br></p>
<section id="a-tiny-flight-server" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a-tiny-flight-server">A tiny flight server</h3>
<p>Our goal in this section is to write our own flight server in Python that does the same job as the one we saw earlier in the R example: it’s a server that allows you to cache copies of Arrow tables. To do so, we’ll start our Python script the way one usually does, with some imports:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>tiny_flight.py</strong></pre>

<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb25" data-startfrom="3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python numberLines number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python" style="counter-reset: source-line 2;"><span id="cb25-3"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span> pyarrow <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">as</span> pa</span>

</div>
</div>
<p>What I’ll do now is define a Python class called <code>TinyServer</code>. The job of this class is to provide server side flight methods for <code>do_get()</code>, <code>do_put()</code>, and others. We’ll be able to use this class to create specific server instances and set them running, in more or less the exact same fashion that we did previously in the R example.</p>
<p>I’ll explain the code in more detail in a moment after I’ve shown you both the server and the client, but let’s start just by looking at the code. You can find all the code in the <a href="tiny_flight.py">tiny_flight.py</a> script that accompanies this post. Here’s the complete code used to define the <code>TinyServer</code> class:</p>

<p>Now, if you’re at all like me this code won’t immediately make sense. Probably you’ll skim over it, read bits of it, and <em>some</em> of it will make sense… but not all of it. There’s a couple of reasons for that. The first and most obvious reason is that it’s a big chunk of code that I haven’t explained yet! The second reason is that (in my opinion) server-side code never makes sense on its own: it only really makes sense when you can place it next to the client-side code so that you can see how the two parts fit together.<sup>7</sup> With that in mind, let’s take a quick peek at the client-side code…</p>

<p>To accompany a <code>TinyServer</code>, we’ll need a <code>TinyClient</code> that knows how to talk to it. Happily for us, it’s easier to define the client than to define the server, so the source code that defines the <code>TinyClient</code> class is considerably shorter:</p>

<p>These two classes are designed to work in concert: the <code>do_put()</code> method for <code>TinyServer</code> is aligned with the <code>do_put()</code> method for <code>TinyClient</code>,<sup>8</sup> and the <code>put_table()</code> function I wrote on the client side is a convenient high-level wrapper that manages the whole “put a table on the server” interaction without requiring the user to do anything other than write a single line of code. That’s the reason I started by showing you all the source code for both parts before explaining any of the specific methods: in the next few sections I’ll walk you through the code, placing the relevant snippets from the server code and the client code next to each other so you can more clearly see how they relate to each other.</p>

</div>
<p>Some things to notice here. At start up, the server and client both call the <code>flight.Location.for_grpc_tcp()</code> function to generate a <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.flight.Location.html">Location</a> object used to specify the address of the server:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb30" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb30-1">loc <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> flight.Location.for_grpc_tcp(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'localhost'</span>, <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">5678</span>)</span>
<span id="cb30-2"><span class="bu" style="color: null;">print</span>(loc)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>&lt;Location b'grpc+tcp://localhost:5678'&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The important thing in this output is the server address. The <code>localhost:5678</code> part indicates that the server is running locally on port 5678, and the <code>grpc+tcp://</code> part tells us what communication protocols are being used. For this server, those protocols are <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>. TCP is probably familiar to most data scientists since it’s one of the core protocols of the internet, but gRPC (wonderful as it is) is a little more specialised. I’m not going to talk about how gRPC works in this post, but there are some references at the end. For now, it’s sufficient to recognise that this location object does store the server address. If I’d really wanted to, I could have written code that constructs this string manually<sup>9</sup> but there’s no need to do that when the pyarrow flight module supplies built-in location classes to do this for us!</p>
<p>The rest of the code is used for initialisation. On the server side, we initialise the server object as an instance of the parent class (i.e., <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.flight.FlightServerBase.html">FlightServerBase</a>). On the client side, the first action is to call <code>flight.connect()</code>: this is also an initialisation action that returns an instance of the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.flight.FlightClient.html">FlightClient</a> class. In other words there’s a kind of symmetry here: the <code>TinyServer</code> is built on top of the <code>FlightServerBase</code> class, and the <code>TinyClient</code> is built on top of the <code>FlightClient</code> class.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>The other thing to notice here is the data structures set up in these initialisations. On the server side we create an empty dictionary called <code>tables</code> (referred to as <code>self.tables</code> since it belongs to the instance not the class) that the server uses to store any data sets that it is sent. On the client side, the <code>self.connection</code> object is used to represent our connection to the server: this object is an instance of the <code>FlightClient</code> class, and it comes equipped with client side methods for <code>do_put()</code>, <code>do_get()</code> etc. Finally, notice that the last action that the client takes when it is initialised is to wait for the connection to the server to be established.</p>

<p>Next, let’s take a look at the code used to place data on the server. On the server side, we have to specify the <code>do_put()</code> method. In this case, all my code does is store a copy of the data in <code>self.tables</code> and prints a little message to the server console using the <code>server_message()</code> function:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>There’s a few things to comment on here. First, let’s note that the <code>server_message()</code> function isn’t very interesting for our purposes. It exists solely to print out messages,<sup>11</sup> thereby allowing the server to announce what it’s doing, but the server would work just fine without these messages. However, it does give me an opportunity to mention some things about the arguments to the various functions defined in this code:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>server_message()</code> is a static method – which is why it doesn’t take a <code>self</code> argument. The arguments listed in the function definition are exactly the same as the arguments that are included in function calls later.</p></li>
<li><p><code>do_put()</code> is a class method, and so it takes <code>self</code> as the first argument. As is typical for object oriented programming systems, the <code>self</code> argument in class methods is passed implicitly. It’s included in the function definition, but not in the function calls. Internally, what’s going on is that a call like <code>object.method(argument)</code> is translated to <code>Class.method(object, argument)</code> and therefore the object itself implicitly becomes the first argument.</p></li>
<li><p><code>do_put()</code> is an Arrow Flight method (as well as a Python class method), and because of that it also takes a <code>context</code> argument that, much like <code>self</code> is passed implicitly. This post isn’t the place to have that discussion – it’s too long already – but for now it suffices to note that Arrow will handle the <code>context</code> argument for us, in an analogous fashion to how Python handles self for us.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have that sorted, let’s have a look at the part of the code that actually does the server-side work. Specifically, it’s this line in <code>do_put()</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>tiny_flight.py [server]</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb33" data-startfrom="30" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python numberLines number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python" style="counter-reset: source-line 29;"><span id="cb33-30">        <span class="va" style="color: #111111;">self</span>.tables[table_name] <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> reader.read_all()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s unpack this line one step at a time.</p>
<p>The <code>reader</code> object has been passed to the server as one of the arguments to <code>do_put()</code>, and it’s a <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.ipc.RecordBatchStreamReader.html">RecordBatchStreamReader</a>. That is, it’s an object capable of receiving a stream of Arrow data. When the <code>read_all()</code> method is called, it reads all record batches sent by the client and returns the final result as an Arrow table. This table is then stored in the <code>self.tables</code> dictionary.</p>
<p>Next, notice that the key against which the table is stored as the value is specified by <code>descriptor.command</code>. This part of the code also needs to be explained! What is a “descriptor” object? What is the “command” attribute of a descriptor? That’s not at all obvious from inspection. To resolve our confusion, it helps to realise that this <code>descriptor</code> object is one of the arguments to the the server-side <code>do_put()</code> function, and the code that creates this object is over on the the client side. So let’s look at the code I wrote for the client side:</p>

<span id="cb34-106">        writer.close()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here we have a <code>put_table()</code> function written in Python that does roughly the same job that the <code>flight_put()</code> function was doing for us in the R example I presented earlier. It’s a high-level wrapper function that sends a <code>do_put()</code> call to the server, streams the data across, and then stops. This line of code in this function is the one that makes the <code>do_put()</code> call:</p>

<span id="cb35-102">                         .connection                <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">\</span></span>
<span id="cb35-103">                         .do_put(descriptor,</span>

</div>
</div>
<p>Okay, so the <code>descriptor</code> on the client side is also the thing that later gets used on the server side to create the key against which the table is stored. If we look at the preceding line of code, we can see that the <code>descriptor</code> object is an instance of the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.flight.FlightDescriptor.html">FlightDescriptor</a> class. So let’s actually step into the Python console and run the commands required to create a flight descriptor object:<sup>12</sup></p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb36" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb36-1">table_name <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">b'name-of-data'</span></span>

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>&lt;FlightDescriptor command: b'name-of-data'&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the <code>command</code> attribute is in fact the (byte encoded) string that we used to specify the <code>name</code>. In other words, once we strip back all the layers here it turns out that the server stores the data set using the name that the client gave it!</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>On the client side, the <code>get_table()</code> helper function that I’ve written does two things. First it creates a <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.flight.Ticket.html">Ticket</a> object from the <code>name</code> of the data table to be retrieved. It then calls the <code>do_get()</code> flight method to communicate with the server. Then, using the <code>reader</code> object returned by <code>do_get()</code>, it streams the data from the server. The server side code is the mirror image: when the ticket is received, it uses this ticket to retrieve the specific <code>table</code> from <code>self.tables</code>, and returns a stream.</p>
<p>Looking at these two code extracts side by side we can see that the ticket object returned client-side by <code>flight.Ticket()</code> gets used server-side to retrieve the requested table. So we should take a look at what happens here. What we hope to see is that this ticket produces the same key used to store the data originally: that is, when the server specifies a storage key with <code>table_name = ticket.ticket</code> in the <code>do_get()</code> method, it should match the key created by <code>do_put()</code> when <code>table_name = descriptor.command</code> was executed.</p>
<p>Let’s verify that this is true!</p>
<p>Since I already have a <code>table_name</code> object lying around from earlier, let’s run that line of code shall we?</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb42" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb42-1">ticket <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> flight.Ticket(table_name)</span>
<span id="cb42-2"><span class="bu" style="color: null;">print</span>(ticket)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>&lt;Ticket b'name-of-data'&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>That looks promising. If we take a peek at <code>ticket.ticket</code>, we see that – yet again – under the hood the ticket is just an alias for the name of the data set:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb44" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb44-1">ticket.ticket</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>b'name-of-data'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Well that’s a relief. In the server-side code, the <code>descriptor.command</code> object and the <code>ticket.ticket</code> object both produce the correct key used to index a table.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-information">Getting information</h3>
<p>Our journey through the source code continues. On the client side I’ve written a function called <code>list_tables()</code> that returns the names of all tables stored on the server. Here’s what that looks like:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>tiny_flight.py [client]</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb46" data-startfrom="114" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python numberLines number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python" style="counter-reset: source-line 113;"><span id="cb46-114">    <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">def</span> list_tables(<span class="va" style="color: #111111;">self</span>):</span>
<span id="cb46-115">        names <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> []</span>
<span id="cb46-116">        <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">for</span> flight <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">in</span> <span class="va" style="color: #111111;">self</span>.connection.list_flights():</span>
<span id="cb46-117">            table_name <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> flight.descriptor.command</span>
<span id="cb46-118">            names.append(table_name.decode(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'utf-8'</span>))</span>
<span id="cb46-119">        <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">return</span> names</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The key part of this function is the call to <code>self.connection.list_flights()</code>. That’s where the client contacts the server and requests information. Everything else in the function is there to extract the one piece of information (the name of the table) that we’re interested in and return it to the user.</p>
<p>Pivoting over to the server code, there are two flight methods that are relevant here. The <code>get_flight_info()</code> function is a flight method that returns information about a single flight – where, in this case, there’s a one-to-one mapping between flights and tables – and the <code>list_flights()</code> method can be used to retrieve information about all flights stored on the server:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>There’s two things to comment on here. First, note that the <code>list_flight()</code> method iterates<sup>13</sup> over all the stored keys in the <code>tables</code> dictionary, uses the key to construct a flight descriptor, and then calls the <code>flight_info()</code> helper function that I’ll explain in a moment. In contrast, the <code>get_flight_info()</code> function receives a flight descriptor directly from the client, so it’s much simpler: it just calls <code>flight_info()</code> directly.</p>
<p>Okay, so now let’s have a look at the <code>flight_info()</code> helper method. Here’s the code for that one:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>tiny_flight.py [server]</strong></pre>

<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb48" data-startfrom="38" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python numberLines number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python" style="counter-reset: source-line 37;"><span id="cb48-38">    <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">def</span> flight_info(<span class="va" style="color: #111111;">self</span>, descriptor):</span>

<span id="cb48-45">                                         [location])</span>
<span id="cb48-46">        </span>
<span id="cb48-47">        <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">return</span> flight.FlightInfo(table.schema, </span>
<span id="cb48-48">                                 descriptor, </span>
<span id="cb48-49">                                 [endpoint], </span>
<span id="cb48-50">                                 table.num_rows,</span>
<span id="cb48-51">                                 table.nbytes)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s start by looking at the return value. It’s a <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.flight.FlightInfo.html">FlightInfo</a> object and as I mentioned earlier there are five things needed to create it:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>table.schema</code> is the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.Schema.html">Schema</a> for the data stored by the flight</li>
<li>The flight <code>descriptor</code> object, which was passed as input</li>
<li>A list of one or more <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.flight.FlightEndpoint.html">FlightEndpoint</a> objects – in this cases, <code>[endpoint]</code> is a list containing a single endpoint – that specifies where the data are available for streaming. Each endpoint includes a <code>location</code> from which to stream, and the associated <code>ticket</code> for that location</li>
<li>The total number of records can be accessed from <code>table.num_rows</code></li>
<li>The total number of bytes can be accessed from <code>table.nbytes</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at the rest of the function, you can see that the list of endpoints requires a little work to construct. We need to call <code>flight.Ticket()</code> to construct a ticket object, we need to extract the server <code>location</code> that we stored when the server was initialised, and then we need to call <code>flight.Endpoint()</code> to put these things together. There’s a little more code involved, but thankfully it’s not conceptually difficult.</p>

<section id="custom-actions" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="custom-actions">Custom actions</h3>
<p>We’ve encountered (and implemented) four of the methods defined by the Arrow Flight protocol, and as we’ve seen they server different purposes. The <code>do_put()</code> and <code>do_get()</code> methods are used to stream data to and from the server.<sup>14</sup> In contrast, the <code>get_flight_info()</code> and <code>list_flights()</code> methods are used to retrieve metadata about the data stored on the server. In this example, these four methods are sufficient to provide all the core functionality. I could stop here if I absolutely wanted to. But there’s one more method I want to draw your attention to: <code>do_action()</code>. In recognition of the fact that real world applications will always need to perform custom operations that weren’t originally built into the protocol, the <code>do_action()</code> method exists to allow the client to request (and the server to perform) custom actions that you can define however you like.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of how this works, we’ll add two custom actions to our server: when the client requests a <code>'drop_table'</code> action, the corresponding table will be deleted from the server, and when the client requests a <code>'shutdown'</code> action the server will shut itself down.<sup>15</sup> Let’s take a look at the server-side code implementing this:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The <code>do_action()</code> method expects to receive an <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.flight.Action.html">Action</a> object as input to the <code>action</code> argument. The <code>action.type</code> attribute is where the name of the action is stored, so the code here uses if-else to decide which action to perform, or raise an error if the action type is not recognised. The code implementing the actions is pretty minimal. On a shutdown action, the server calls the <code>self.shutdown()</code> method: this is inherited from FlightServerBase, I didn’t have to implement it myself. For a drop table action, the server inspects the <code>action.body</code> argument to determine the name of the table to be dropped, and then deletes it from <code>self.tables</code>.<sup>16</sup></p>
<p>How does the client call this method? To see an example of this, let’s flip over to the client side of the code and look at the <code>drop_table()</code> function:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>tiny_flight.py [client]</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb50" data-startfrom="121" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode numberSource python numberLines number-lines code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python" style="counter-reset: source-line 120;"><span id="cb50-121">    <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">def</span> drop_table(<span class="va" style="color: #111111;">self</span>, name):</span>
<span id="cb50-122">        table_name <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> name.encode(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'utf8'</span>)</span>
<span id="cb50-123">        drop <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> flight.Action(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'drop_table'</span>, table_name) </span>
<span id="cb50-124">        <span class="va" style="color: #111111;">self</span>.connection.do_action(drop)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Happily, it turns out to be simple: first we call <code>flight.Action()</code> to construct the action object itself, passing the action type and action body as arguments. Then we call the built-in <code>do_action()</code> client-side method, which as usual we can access from the <code>self.connection</code> object.</p>
<p>Voilà! We are done. The server and client are both ready to go. Let’s take them for a spin, shall we?</p>

<section id="using-our-server" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-our-server">Using our server</h3>
<p>Let’s start with a few imports. In this demonstration I’m going to read data from csv files, so I’ll import the csv submodule from pyarrow. Obviously, I’ll also need access to the server classes, and since the <a href="tiny_flight.py">tiny_flight.py</a> script is bundled with this post I can import that too. Finally, I’m going to start the server running in its own thread, so I’ll import threading too:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb51" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb51-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span> threading</span>
<span id="cb51-2"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span> tiny_flight <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">as</span> tiny</span>
<span id="cb51-3"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">from</span> pyarrow <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span> csv</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next, I’ll initialise a server running on port 9001 and start it running in its own thread. This will turn out to be handy because when the client starts interacting with the server, we’ll see the server messages as well as the client output!</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb52" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb52-1">server <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> tiny.TinyServer(port <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">9001</span>)</span>
<span id="cb52-2">thread <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> threading.Thread(target <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">lambda</span>: server.serve(), </span>
<span id="cb52-3">                          daemon <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="va" style="color: #111111;">True</span>)</span>
<span id="cb52-4">thread.start()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now that the server is up and running, let’s instantiate a client and have it connect to the server:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb53" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb53-1">client <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> tiny.TinyClient(port <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">9001</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>(server) list_flights  </code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice the message prefixed with <code>(server)</code> here: that part of the output is generated by the server running in the thread. It’s not client-side output. We’re only seeing it here because when the client is initialised by the call to <code>flight.connect()</code>, it calls the <code>list_flights()</code> flight method, and the server prints a message using its internal <code>server_message()</code> function.</p>
<p>Okay. So far so good. Our next step is to create some Arrow tables client side. To make this simpler I have csv files containing copies of the freely-available <a href="https://rdrr.io/cran/bestglm/man/AirQuality.html">1973 New York city air quality</a> and <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/quakes">earthquakes near Fiji since 1964</a> data sets that are both bundled by the datasets R package. I’ll import them both as pyarrow tables:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb55" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb55-1">fijiquakes <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> csv.read_csv(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"fijiquakes.csv"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb55-2">airquality <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> csv.read_csv(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"airquality.csv"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>At the moment both tables exist on the client, and we’d like to cache them on the server. We can do this by calling the <code>put_table()</code> method:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb56" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb56-1">client.put_table(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"fijiquakes"</span>, fijiquakes)</span>
<span id="cb56-2">client.put_table(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"airquality"</span>, airquality)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>(server) do_put fijiquakes
(server) do_put airquality</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Again, notice that the server prints messages which make clear that the data have arrived on the server side. Of course, the client doesn’t actually know this because my server-side code for <code>do_put()</code> doesn’t implement a server response for the client. But no matter: the client can check manually by calling <code>list_tables()</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb58" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb58-1">client.list_tables()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>(server) list_flights  
['fijiquakes', 'airquality']</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here we see two lines of output: the first one is the server-side log, and the second is the output returned client-side showing that both tables exist on the server.</p>
<p>We can take this a step further, of course, by retrieving the data from the server cache. We can do that straightforwardly by calling <code>get_table()</code>, and again see that a server-side message is printed, while the table itself is returned to the client:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb60" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb60-1">client.get_table(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"fijiquakes"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

<p>Now, perhaps we decided that we don’t need a cached copy of the airquality table any longer. We can ask the server to remove it by calling <code>drop_table()</code>, and we can confirm the result by calling <code>list_tables()</code> again:</p>

<p>Compared to the rest of the Apache Arrow project, it’s not so easy to find tutorials and documentation about flight. It’s still a little piecemeal. With that in mind, here’s an annotated reading list that will be helpful if you want to explore flight further:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/10/13/introducing-arrow-flight/">The original announcement of flight</a> by Wes McKinney on the Apache Arrow blog gives a very good overview of the motivation for why flight was introduced.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://voltrondata.com/news/data-transfer-at-the-speed-of-flight/">Data transfer at the speed of flight</a> by Tom Drabas, Fernanda Foertter, and David Li. This is a blog post on the Voltron Data blog that provides a concrete example of a working flight server written in Python. The Python code I’ve discussed in this post is an elaboration of the content in that post. It’s a good starting point.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://voltrondata.com/news/apache-arrow-flight-primer/">Apache Arrow Flight: A Primer</a> by David Li and Tom Drabas. This is another blog post on the Voltron Data website. This one doesn’t have any working code for you to look at, but it provides a good summary of the technologies that Arrow Flight is built upon. It’s a little intense for novices but is pretty handy for intermediate level users who want to take a peek under the hood.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/flight.html">The Python documentation flight vignette</a> is pretty readable and goes into a moderate amount of detail, but be aware it implicitly assumes some familiarity with remote procedure calls.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook/py/flight.html">The Python cookbook for Arrow</a> contains the most thorough worked example I’ve seen anywhere. It’s a little dense for novice users, but it’s still the one of the most comprehensive resources I’ve seen, and the only one that talks about issues like authentication (which I have not discussed at all here!)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/flight.html">The R documentation flight vignette</a> has a succinct overview of how you can use the high-level interface provided by <code>flight_put()</code>, <code>flight_get()</code>, etc. What it doesn’t do (yet?) is discuss the low-level features. At the moment you won’t find a discussion of say <code>client$do_get()</code> and how it relates to <code>flight_get()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Along similar lines there are some examples in the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/cookbook/r/flight.html">R cookbook</a>, but they are also quite minimal.</p></li>
<li><p>Should you be interested in writing an Arrow Flight service in C++, the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/cpp/flight.html">documentation pages for the C++ Flight implementation</a> may come in handy!</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re willing to spend some money I thoroughly recommend the chapter on Arrow flight in Matt Topol’s book <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/in-memory-analytics-with-apache-arrow/9781801071031">In-Memory Analytics with Apache Arrow</a>. I found it really helpful for cementing my own understanding. In addition to the worked examples in Python, C++, and Go, the chapter provides some historical context for understanding the difference between RPC frameworks and REST frameworks, and is also the only resource I’m aware of that goes into detail about how more sophisticated network architectures are supported by flight.</p></li>
<li><p>If you’re keen to understand what is happening under the hood, at some point you’re going to want to read about gRPC. The flight protocol is built on top of gRPC, and a lot of the advanced content you’ll encounter on flight doesn’t make a lot of sense until you’ve started to wrap your head around it. To that end, I found the <a href="https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/introduction/">introduction to gRPC</a> documentation really helpful. You may also want to take a look at the documentation for <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protocol buffers</a> because in practice that’s doing a lot of the work for us here!</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to understand the backdrop against which all this sits, it’s also pretty handy to do a bit of digging around and reading the history around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">remote procedure call (RPC) approaches to distributed computing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">representational state transfer (REST) approaches</a>. Even skimming the two linked Wikipedia articles was helpful for me.</p></li>
<li><p>When digging around in source code, I found it handy to take a look at these parts of the code base: source code for the <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/r/inst/demo_flight_server.py">R demo server</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/examples/flight/server.py">Python example server</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/apache/arrow/blob/master/python/pyarrow/_flight.pyx">pyarrow flight implementation</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, while neither one is ideal as a place to start, once I started getting the hang of what I was doing, I have found it handy to browse through the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/api/flight.html">Python flight API reference pages</a>, and to occasionally dip into the official <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html">Arrow flight RPC specification</a>. Regarding the latter, my experience was that the images showing how each of the flight methods operates were handy, and the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html#protocol-buffer-definitions">comments</a> shown in the in the “protocol buffer definitions” are nice because they’re maybe the clearest verbal description of what each of the flight methods expects as input and what objects they will return.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Happy hunting!</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>All the way back to October 2019, which is like ancient history by Arrow standards. Sigh. This project moves too damned fast to keep pace with it all.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>One of my favourite things about having a quarto blog is that every post is a notebook. It’s technically possible to “cheat” by including hidden code chunks that execute different code than that shown in the post, but it’s something I do very sparingly and only when there’s some weirdness involved. I’m not doing that here. When this post is rendered, it does start a new instance of the demo server in a different R session: every flight server demonstrated here is in fact running in the background so that the post renders, and server side data are all stored by those other processes. There really is no copy of the <code>pollution_data</code> object in the R session used to render this post. It’s somewhere else, as it bloody well should be.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Specifically, when the client calls the <code>do_put()</code> method, a <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/RecordBatchWriter.html">RecordBatchStreamWriter</a> object is returned. This object in turn has <code>write_batch()</code> and <code>write_table()</code> methods that can be used to stream data. It’s a bit beyond the scope of the post to talk about the details here, but if you ever find yourself needing to use this capability this is where to start!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Optionally, you can also pass a third “options” argument.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>The examples in this post are simple ones where the server doesn’t actually send a response, so the reader object isn’t used for anything↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>As an aside, it’s not clear to me that this will remain true in the long run. There are a lot of advantages to having access to all the features of the Arrow Flight RPC specification, and if my dev skills are up to the task I may attempt to update the R bindings. No promises though :-)↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>If I were so inclined I’d probably point out this is the maybe the clearest illustration that we’re adopting an RPC approach to distributed computing – this is not a REST API. After all, if the server code doesn’t make sense without looking at the client code, there’s a pretty good chance you don’t meet the “uniform interface” REST criterion. This isn’t a criticism of flight, of course: there are good reasons to adopt a non-RESTful RPC approach sometimes. However, that’s beyond the scope of this post. It’s already too long as it is!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Okay fine, I’m oversimplifying a little here. Technically, the <code>TinyClient</code> object does not have a <code>do_put()</code> method: that’s actually a property of the <code>connection</code> object attached to every <code>TinyClient</code> object.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>People with more experience in Python (well, more than me) would notice the importance of the <code>b''</code> notation. One thing I didn’t know about Python until recently is that it is quite explicit in specifying how strings are encoded. The <code>b''</code> notation is used to indicate that this is a “byte literal” string. To convert it to utf-8 text, it needs to be explicitly decoded. I mention this here because later on in the post I’m going to call <code>.encode()</code> and <code>.decode()</code> string methods to switch back and forth between byte literals and utf-8 strings. I’m assuming this is common knowledge among Python users, but coming from R this was a little surprising!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>That said, the symmetry isn’t exact: the <code>TinyServer</code> object explicitly subclasses <code>FlightServerBase</code> and overrides several of its methods in order to provide server functionality. In contrast, <code>TinyClient</code> is not a subclass. Rather, every <code>TinyClient</code> object contains a <code>connection</code> object that is a <code>FlightClient</code> instance. The explicitly-defined methods for the <code>TinyClient</code> class internally call the methods of the <code>connection</code> object whenever the client needs to call a flight method.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>As an aside, note that all the “strings” that the client and server are using to represent tickets, locations, etc are represented as byte literals. That means that the <code>name</code> argument that gets passed to <code>server_message()</code> will always be a byte literal, not utf-8 encoded. In order to print a message to the console, we need to decode the bytes into utf-8 format, which is why the code for <code>server_message()</code> uses <code>name.decode("utf-8")</code>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>In this example I’ve used the <code>for_command()</code> method to construct the flight descriptor. This isn’t the only way to do it: you can use the <code>for_path()</code> method also. I’m only mentioning this because when you look at the code used in other flight servers, you’ll sometimes see the <code>for_path()</code> method used in a similar fashion to the way I’m using <code>for_command()</code> here.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>For fellow Python newbies: if you’re unsure about why <code>list_flights()</code> generates return values with <code>yield</code> rather than <code>return</code>, it’s worth taking a little time to read up on Python iterables and generators. There’s an excellent explanation on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do">this stackoverflow question</a>↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>There is also a <code>do_exchange()</code> method that allows bidirectional streaming, but I’m not going to talk about it in this post↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>I mean yeah, in real life you might want to have some… um… authentication in place before letting an arbitrary client take these kinds of actions, but I’m not going to talk about that here!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>If I were being more rigorous I’d include some input checking here, but let’s be realistic: that’s not even close to the most unsafe thing about my simple example. I cannot stress enough that this code is for explanatory purposes, it’s not production code!↩︎</p></li>

<p>In the <a href="../../posts/2022-09-09_reticulated-arrow/">last post on this blog</a> I showed how <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a> makes it possible to hand over data sets from R to Python (and vice versa) without making wasteful copies of the data.</p>
<p>The solution I outlined there was to use the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/">reticulate</a> package to conduct the handover, and rely on Arrow tools both sides to manage the data. In one sense it’s a perfectly good solution to the problem… but it’s a solution tailor made for R users who need access to Python. When viewed from the perspective of a Python user who needs access to R, it’s a little awkward to have an R package (reticulate) governing the handover.<sup>1</sup> Perhaps we can find a more Pythonic way to approach this?</p>
<p>A solution to our problem is provided by the <a href="https://rpy2.github.io/">rpy2 library</a> that provides an interface to R from Python, and the <a href="https://rpy2.github.io/rpy2-arrow/version/main/html/index.html">rpy2-arrow extension</a> that allows it to support Arrow objects. Let’s take a look, shall we?</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-up-the-python-environment">Setting up the Python environment</h2>
<p>For the purposes of this post I’ll create a fresh conda environment that I’ll call “continuation”, partly because this post is a continuation of the previous one and partly because the data set I’ll use later is taken from a database of serialised fiction called <a href="https://cdhrdatasys.anu.edu.au/tobecontinued/">To Be Continued…</a>.</p>
<p>I was able install most packages I need through conda-forge, but for rpy2 and rpy2-arrow I was only able to do so from pypi so I had to use pip for that. So the code for setting up my Python environment, executed at the terminal, was as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">conda</span> create <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-n</span> continuation</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">conda</span> install <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-n</span> continuation pip pyarrow pandas jupyter</span>

<span id="cb1-4"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">pip</span> install rpy2 rpy2-arrow</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As long as I render this post with the “continuation” environment active everything works smoothly.<sup>3</sup></p>

<section id="introducing-rpy2" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introducing-rpy2">Introducing rpy2</h2>
<p>The purpose of the rpy2 library is to allow users to call R from Python, typically with the goal of allowing access to statistical packages distributed through <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>. I’m currently using version 3.5.4, and while this blog post won’t even come close to documenting the full power of the library, the <a href="https://rpy2.github.io/doc/v3.5.x/html/index.html#">rpy2 documentation</a> is quite extensive. To give you a bit of a flavour of it, let’s import the library:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="1">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span> rpy2</span>
<span id="cb2-2">rpy2.__version__</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="1">
<pre><code>'3.5.4'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This does not in itself give us access to R. That doesn’t happen until we explicitly import either the <code>robjects</code> module (a high level interface to R) or import the <code>rinterface</code> model (a low level interface) and call <code>rinterface.initr()</code>. This post won’t cover <code>rinterface</code> at all; we can accomplish everything we need to using only the high level interface provided by <code>robjects</code>. So let’s import the module and, in doing so, start R running as a child process:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="2">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span> rpy2.robjects <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">as</span> robjects</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code></code></pre>
</div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>R version 4.2.1 (2022-06-23) 🌈</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>You’ll notice that this prints a little startup message. If you’re following along at home you’ll probably see something different on your own machine: most likely you’ll see the standard R startup message here. It’s shorter in this output because I modified my <code>.Rprofile</code> to make R less chatty on start up.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Anyway, our next step is to load some packages. In native R code we’d use the <code>library()</code> function for this, but rpy2 provides a more Pythonic approach. Importing the packages submodule gives us access to <code>importr()</code>, which is allows us to load packages. The code below illustrates how you can expose the base R package and the utils R package (both of which come bundled with any minimal R installation) to Python:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="3">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span> rpy2.robjects.packages <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">as</span> pkgs</span>
<span id="cb7-2"></span>
<span id="cb7-3">base <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> pkgs.importr(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"base"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb7-4">utils <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> pkgs.importr(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"utils"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once we have access to utils we can call the R function <code>install.packages()</code> to install additional packages from CRAN. However, at this point we need to talk a little about how names are translated by rpy2. As every Python user would immediately notice, <code>install.packages()</code> is not a valid function name in Python: the dot is a special character and not permitted within the name of a function. In contrast, although not generally recommended in R except in special circumstances,<sup>5</sup> function names containing dots are syntactically valid in R and there are functions that use them. So how do we resolve this?</p>
<p>In most cases, the solution is straightforward: rpy2 will automatically convert dots in R to underscores in Python, and so in this instance the function name becomes <code>install_packages()</code>. For example, if I want to install the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=fortunes">fortunes</a> package using rpy2, I would use the following command:<sup>6</sup></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb8-1">utils.install_packages(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"fortunes"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are some subtleties around function name translation, however. I won’t talk about them in this post, other to mention that the documentation discusses this in the section on <a href="https://rpy2.github.io/doc/v2.9.x/html/robjects_functions.html">calling functions</a>.</p>
<p>In any case, now that I have successfully installed the fortunes package I can import it, allowing me to call the <code>fortune()</code> function:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="4">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb9" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb9-1">ftns <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> pkgs.importr(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"fortunes"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb9-2">ftn7 <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> ftns.fortune(<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">7</span>)</span>
<span id="cb9-3"><span class="bu" style="color: null;">print</span>(ftn7)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>I’m rather fond of this quote, and it seems very appropriate to the spirit of what polyglot data science is all about. Whatever language or tools we’re working in, we’ve usually chosen them for good reason. But there is no tool that works all the time, nor any language that is ideal for every situation. Sometimes we need something very different, and when we do it is very helpful if our tools able to talk fluently to each other.</p>
<p>We’re now at the point that we can tackle the problem of transferring data from Python to R, but in order to do that we’ll need some data…</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="about-the-data">About the data</h2>
<p>I’ve given you so many teasers about the data set for this post that it almost feels a shame to spoil it by revealing the data, but all good things must come to an end I suppose. The data I’m using are taken from the <a href="https://cdhrdatasys.anu.edu.au/tobecontinued/">To Be Continued…</a> database of fiction published in Australian newspapers during the 19th and early 20th century. Originally collected using the incredibly cool <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/">Trove</a> resource run by the National Library of Australia, the <em>To Be Continued…</em> data are released under a CC-BY-4.0 licence and maintained by Katherine Bode and Carol Hetherington. I’m not using the full data set here, only the metadata. In the complete database you can find full text of published pieces, and in the Trove links you can find the digitised resources from which they were sourced, but I don’t need that level of detail here. All I need is an interesting data table that I can pass around between languages. For that, the metadata alone will suffice!</p>
<p>To give you a sense of what the data set (that is, the restricted version I’m using here) looks like, let’s fire up <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> and take a peek at the structure of the table. It’s stored as a CSV file, so I’ll call <code>read_csv()</code> to import the data:</p>

<p>Okay, that’s helpful. We can see what all the columns are and what kind of data they contain. I’m still pretty new to data science workflows in Python, but it’s not too difficult to do a little bit of data wrangling with Pandas. For instance, we can take a look at the distribution of nationalities among published authors. The table shown below counts the number of distinct publications (Trove IDs) and authors for each nationality represented in the data:</p>

<p>It would not come as any surprise, at least not to anyone with a sense of Australian history, that there were far more British authors than Australian authors published in Australian newspapers during that period. I was mildly surprised to see so many American authors represented though, and I have nothing but love for the lone Italian who published 12 pieces.</p>
<p>Now that we have a sense of the data, let’s add Arrow to the mix!</p>

<p>The <code>fiction2</code> object contains the same data as <code>fiction</code> but it is structured as an Arrow Table, and the data is stored in memory allocated by Arrow. Python itself only stores some metadata and the C++ pointer that refers to the Arrow Table. This isn’t exciting, but it will be important (and powerful!) later in a moment we transfer the data to R.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, we have arrived at the point where we get to do the fun part… seamlessly handing the reins back and forth between Python and R without needing to copy the Arrow Table itself.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
</section>
<section id="passing-tables-from-python-to-r" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="passing-tables-from-python-to-r">Passing Tables from Python to R</h2>
<p>To pass Arrow objects between Python and R, rpy2 needs a little help because it doesn’t know how to handle Arrow data structures. That’s where the <a href="https://rpy2.github.io/rpy2-arrow/version/main/html/index.html">rpy2-arrow module</a> comes in. As the documentation states:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The package allows the sharing of Apache Arrow data structures (Array, ChunkedArray, Field, RecordBatch, RecordBatchReader, Table, Schema) between Python and R within the same process. The underlying C/C++ pointer is shared, meaning potentially large gain in performance compared to regular arrays or data frames shared between Python and R through the conversion rules included in rpy2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I won’t attempt to give a full tutorial on rpy2-arrow in this post. Instead, I’ll just show you how to use it to solve the problem at hand. Our first step is to import the conversion tools from rpy_arrow:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="8">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb15" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb15-1"><span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">import</span> rpy2_arrow.pyarrow_rarrow <span class="im" style="color: #00769E;">as</span> pyra</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Having done that, the <code>pyarrow_table_to_r_table()</code> function allows us to pass an Arrow Table from Python to R:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="9">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb16" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb16-1">fiction3 <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> pyra.pyarrow_table_to_r_table(fiction2)</span>
<span id="cb16-2">fiction3</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="9">
<pre><code>&lt;rpy2.rinterface_lib.sexp.SexpEnvironment object at 0x7f71bfb8a6c0&gt; [RTYPES.ENVSXP]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The printed output isn’t the prettiest thing in the world, but nevertheless it does represent the object of interest. On the Python side we have <code>fiction2</code>, a data structure that points to an Arrow Table and enables various compute operations supplied through pyarrow. On the R side we have now created <code>fiction3</code>, a data structure that points to the <em>same</em> Arrow Table and enables compute operations supplied by the R arrow package. In the same way that <code>fiction2</code> only stores a small amount of metadata in Python, <code>fiction3</code> stores a small amount of metadata in R. Only this metadata has been copied from Python to R: the data itself remains untouched in Arrow.</p>

<p>We’re almost done, but the tour isn’t really complete until we’ve stepped out of Python entirely, manipulated the object on the R side, and then passed something back to Python. So let’s do that next.</p>
<p>In order to pull off that trick within this <a href="https://quarto.org/">quarto</a> document – which is running <a href="https://jupyter.org/">jupyter</a> under the hood – we’ll need to employ a little notebook magic, again relying on rpy2 to supply all the sparkly bits.

</div>
<p>Now that we’ve included this line, all I have to do is preface each cell with <code>%%R</code> and the subsequent “Python” code will be passed to R and interpreted there.<sup>7</sup> To start with I’ll load the dplyr and arrow packages, using the <code>suppressMessages()</code> function to prevent them being chatty:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="11">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb19" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb19-1"><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">%%</span>R</span>
<span id="cb19-2"></span>
<span id="cb19-3">suppressMessages({</span>
<span id="cb19-4">  library(dplyr)</span>
<span id="cb19-5">  library(arrow)</span>
<span id="cb19-6">})</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Having loaded the relevant packages, I’ll use the dplyr/arrow toolkit to do a little data wrangling on the <code>fiction3</code> Table. I’m not doing anything fancy, just a little cross-tabulation counting the joint distribution of genders and nationalities represented in the data using the <code>count()</code> function, and using <code>arrange()</code> to sort the results:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="12">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb20" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb20-1"><span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">%%</span>R <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">-</span>i fiction3</span>

<span id="cb20-4">  count(Gender, Nationality) <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb20-5">  arrange(desc(n)) <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb20-6">  compute()</span>
<span id="cb20-7">  </span>
<span id="cb20-8">gender</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

</div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

</div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

</div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The output isn’t very informative, but don’t worry, by the end of the post there will be a gender reveal I promise.<sup>8</sup> Besides, the actual values of <code>gender</code> aren’t important right now. In truth, the part that we’re most interested in here is the first line of code. By using <code>%%R -i fiction3</code> to specify the cell magic, we’re able to access the <code>fiction3</code> object from R within this cell and perform the required computations.</p>
<p>Oh, and also we now have a new <code>gender</code> object in our R session that we probably want to pull back into Python!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-journey-home-a-tale-of-four-genders">The journey home: A tale of four genders</h2>
<p>Okay. So we now have an object in the embedded R session that we might wish to access from the Python session and convert to a Python object. First we’ll pass the Arrow Table from R to Python and then convert to a Pandas DataFrame. Here’s how that process works. If you recall from earlier in the post, we imported <code>robjects</code> to start the embedded R session. When we did so, we also exposed <code>robjects.r</code>, which provides access to all objects within that R session. To create a Python object <code>gender2</code> that refers to the R data structure we created in the last section, here’s what we do:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="13">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb25" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb25-1">gender2 <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> robjects.r(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">'gender'</span>)</span>
<span id="cb25-2">gender2</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="13">
<pre><code>&lt;rpy2.robjects.environments.Environment object at 0x7f71b6784bc0&gt; [RTYPES.ENVSXP]
R classes: ('Table', 'ArrowTabular', 'ArrowObject', 'R6')
n items: 36</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Importantly, notice that this is the same object. The <code>gender2</code> variable still refers to the Arrow Table in R: it’s <em>not</em> a pyarrow table. If we want to convert it to a data structure that pyarrow understands, we can again use the rpy-arrow conversion tools. In this case, we can use the <code>rarrow_to_py_table()</code> function:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="14">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb27" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb27-1">gender3 <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> pyra.rarrow_to_py_table(gender2)</span>
<span id="cb27-2">gender3</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-display" data-execution_count="14">
<pre><code>pyarrow.Table
Gender: string
Nationality: string
n: int64
----
Gender: [["Unknown","Male","Female","Male","Female",...,"Both","Female","Female","Female",null]]
Nationality: [["Unknown","British","British","Australian","Australian",...,"Australian/British","British/American","South African","Polish","Australian"]]
n: [[12832,6420,3346,2537,1687,...,1,1,1,1,1]]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Just like that, we’ve handed over the Arrow Table from R back to Python. Again, it helps to remember that <code>gender2</code> is an R object and <code>gender3</code> is a Python object, but both of them point to the same underlying Arrow Table.</p>
<p>In any case, now that we have <code>gender3</code> on the Python side, we can use the <code>to_pandas()</code> method from <code>pyarrow.Table</code> to convert it to a pandas data frame:</p>
<div class="cell" data-execution_count="15">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb29" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb29-1">gender4 <span class="op" style="color: #5E5E5E;">=</span> pyarrow.Table.to_pandas(gender3)</span>
<span id="cb29-2">gender4</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This post has wandered over a few topics, which is perhaps to be expected given the nature of polyglot data science. To make it all work smoothly I needed to think a little about how my Python and R environments are set up: the little asides I buried in footnotes mention the frictions I encountered in getting rpy2 to work smoothly for me, for instance. As someone who primarily uses R it took me a little while to work out how to get quarto to switch cleanly from a knitr engine to a jupyter engine. The R and Python libraries implementing Apache Arrow make it look seamless when we handover data from one language to another – and in some ways they actually do make it seamless in spite of the many little frictions that exist with Arrow, no less than any other powerful and rapidly-growing tool – but a <em>lot</em> of work has gone into making that transition smooth. Whether you’re an R focused developer using reticulate or a Python focused developer who prefers rpy2, the toolkit is there. I’m obviously biased in this because so much of my work revolves around Arrow these days, but at some level I’m still actually shocked that it (and other polyglot tools) works as well as it does. Plus, I’m having a surprising amount of fun teaching myself “Pythonic” ways of thinking and coding, so that’s kind of cool too.</p>
<p>Hopefully this post will help a few other folks get started in this area!</p>

<p>In writing this post I am heavily indebted to Isabella Velásquez, whose fabulous post on <a href="https://rviews.rstudio.com/2022/05/25/calling-r-from-python-with-rpy2/">calling R from Python with rpy2</a> helped me immensely. The <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/integration/python_r.html">documentation on integrating PyArrow with R</a> was extremely helpful too! Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/kae_suarez">Kae Suarez</a> for reviewing this post.</p>


</div></section><section id="footnotes" class="footnotes footnotes-end-of-document"><h2 class="anchored quarto-appendix-heading">Footnotes</h2>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>Relatedly, if you’re a Python user blogging in quarto, you are very unlikely to be using the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-knitr.html">knitr engine</a> to execute code like I did in the last blog post. Instead you’re almost certainly using the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-jupyter.html">jupyter engine</a>. With that in mind, and with the goal of making this post a little more Pythonic, I’m using Jupyter this time.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>A note on image copyright. As far as I can tell all images in this post are public domain. They’re all sourced from Trove and are all over a century old, meaning that they are all covered by the “plus 50 years” rule in Australian copyright law (the current “plus 70” rule does not apply retroactively). The original illustrator is difficult to determine, and given the age of the images so too is any potential copyright holder, but it seems extremely unlikely that any are still covered by any copyright. As always, I will remove any image if I discover that I am incorrect in this.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Ha ha. Just kidding. Aaaaaaaaactualllllllly, it will <em>probably</em> work smoothly for most people. But there are exceptions, and because I am a foolish tinkerer and have a nonstandard R configuration I am one of them. I have recently made the decision to use the <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/rig">rig manager</a> to configure multiple concurrent R installations on my laptop. This introduces a some complexity, because rig necessarily installs R to non standard locations. Now, rig does the right thing and correctly sets the PATH environment variable so that rpy2 (and bash) can find R, but it does lead to some peculiar behaviour where rpy2 doesn’t find some of the C libraries need. In the rpy2 readme there’s a discussion of this issue. In such cases you need to tweak the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable before starting Python: <code>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(python -m rpy2.situation LD_LIBRARY_PATH)":${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}</code>↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>As an aside, it’s worth noting that rpy2 has run R with my default configuration (notwithstanding the fact that my defaults are configured using rig). It hasn’t loaded any specific R environment. It did occur to me that a complete discussion of this topic would also describe how a Python user could use rpy2 to configure the R environment using the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html">renv</a> package for instance, but to be honest that started to feel a little beyond the scope of the post. About the only thing I <em>will</em> mention here is that in this particular use case (namely, passing Arrow objects between R and Python) I would not recommend trying to configure the Python environment and the R environment within the same conda environment. Because that thought occurred to me too. I tried it and oh my… the number of unsolvable conflicts was truly impressive.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>The dot is typically used to denote an <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html">S3</a> method in R, but because R embraces chaos this is not universally adhered to and in any case S3 is… look, I love S3 but as Hadley Wickham once observed it’s an object oriented programming system that absolutely allows you to shoot yourself in the foot if you want to. Anyway. This is not the post for ramblings about the chaotic splendour of R.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Depending on how blank your R configuration is, you may need to specify which CRAN mirror you want to download the package from before attempting the installation. To do that, include a command like <code>utils.chooseCRANmirror(ind=1)</code> to select the first mirror on the list of known servers.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Okay, that brings me to something I didn’t really cover in my last post. Some R users might be wondering about what was going on in the last post where I was flipping back and forth between R and Python without apparently doing anything like this. The answer is that when using <a href="https://yihui.org/knitr/">knitr</a> as the engine rather than jupyter, python code is automatically interpreted with the help of reticulate. However, that feature is exposed by default in the knitr engine so I didn’t need to invoke it explicitly the way I’m doing here in jupyter.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>I’m sorry. The joke was too obvious, yet too hard to resist.↩︎</p></li>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<p>As the 21st century gears up for its quarter-life crisis, the trend in data science is toward multi-language tools. I use <a href="https://quarto.org/">quarto</a> to write this blog, a document preparation system that supports code evaluation in R, Python, Julia, and more. My work revolves around <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a>, a toolbox for data analysis and interchange with implementations in multiple languages. You get the idea. In one sense this new development is fantastic – your language of choice is much more likely to be supported in the future than it ever was in the past. In another sense it is daunting – it sometimes feels like we need to learn <em>all the things</em> in order to get by in this brave new world. Meanwhile we all have our actual jobs to do and we don’t have the time. In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i739SyCu9I">immortal words of Bob Katter</a> commenting on same sex marriage legislation in Australia,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I mean, you know, people are entitled to their sexual proclivities. Let there be a thousand blossoms bloom as far as I’m concerned, you know…</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [<em>pauses, expression turns dark</em>]</p>
<p>…but I ain’t spending any time on it because, in the meantime, every three months a person is torn to pieces by a crocodile in North Queensland</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean, he makes a good point? Or at least, it’s a good point about data science: I’m not convinced it was a stellar contribution to the discussion of LGBT rights in the antipodes.<sup>1</sup> There’s a lot going on in the data science world, none of us can keep pace with all of it, and we’re all trying our best not to be eaten by crocodiles.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-interchange-in-a-polyglot-world">Data interchange in a polyglot world</h2>
<p>In the spirit of saving you from at least one reptilian threat, this post is a primer on how to efficiently pass control of a large data set between R and Python <em>without</em> making any wasteful copies of the data.</p>
<p>The idea to write this post emerged from a recent discussion on Twitter started by <a href="https://twitter.com/mxcatnap/status/1559991199494279169">Cass Wilkinson Saldaña</a> about passing control of a data set from R to Python, and a comment in that discussion by <a href="https://twitter.com/jonkeane/status/1560016227824721920">Jon Keane</a> mentioning that with the assistance of Apache Arrow this handover can be made very smooth, and incredibly efficient too. Unfortunately, to be able to do this you need to know the trick, and as they regretfully mentioned in the thread, the trick isn’t well documented yet.</p>
<p>In time the documentation will of course improve, but in the here-and-now it seems like a good idea to explain how the magic trick works…</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<section id="the-reticulate-trick" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-reticulate-trick">The reticulate trick</h3>
<p>The “trick” is simple: if your data are stored as an Arrow Table, and you use the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/">reticulate</a> package to pass it from R to Python (or vice versa), only the metadata changes hands. Because an Arrow Table has the <em>same</em> structure in-memory when accessed from Python as it does in R, the data set itself does not need to be touched at all. The only thing that needs to happen is the language on the receiving end needs to be told <em>where</em> the data are stored. Or, to put it another way, we just pass a pointer across. This all happens invisibly, so if you know how to use reticulate,<sup>2</sup> you already know almost everything you need to know and can skip straight to the section on passing Arrow objects. If you’re like Danielle-From-Last-Month and have absolutely no idea how reticulate works, read on…</p>

<section id="managing-the-python-environment-from-r" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="managing-the-python-environment-from-r">Managing the Python environment from R</h3>
<p>If reticulate is not already on your system, you can install it from CRAN with <code>install.packages("reticulate")</code>. Once installed, you can load it in the usual fashion:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>[R code]</strong></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">library</span>(reticulate)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>What happens next depends a little on whether you already have a Python set up. If you don’t have a preferred Python configuration on your machine and would like to let reticulate manage everything for you, then you can do something like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="code-with-filename">
<div class="code-with-filename-file">
<pre><strong>[R code]</strong></pre>

<p>This will set you up with a default Python build, managed by a copy of <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html">Miniconda</a> that it installs in an OS-specific location that you can discover by calling <code>miniconda_path()</code>.</p>
<p>The previous approach is a perfectly sensible way to use reticulate, but in the end I took a slightly different path. If you’re like me and already have Python and Miniconda configured on your local machine, you probably <em>don’t</em> want reticulate potentially installing new versions and possibly making a mess of things.<sup>3</sup> You probably want to use your existing set up and ensure that reticulate knows where to find everything. If that’s the case, what you want to do is edit your <code>.Renviron</code> file<sup>4</sup> and set the RETICULATE_MINICONDA_PATH variable. Add a line like this one,</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>where you should specify the path to your Miniconda installation, not mine 😁</p>
<p>Regardless of which method you’ve followed, you can use <code>conda_list()</code> to display a summary of all your Python environments.<sup>5</sup> Somehow, despite the fact that I went to the effort of setting everything up, I haven’t used Python much on this machine, so my list of environments is short:</p>

<p>Now that my environment is set up I’m ready to use Python. When calling Python code from within R, some code translation is necessary due to the differences in syntax across languages. As a simple example, let’s say I have my regular Python session open and I want to check my Python version and executable. To do this I’d import the sys library:</p>

<p>Okay, now that we understand the basics of reticulate, it’s time to tackle the problem of transferring data sets between R and Python. For now, let’s leave Arrow out of this. All we’re going to do is take an ordinary R data frame and transfer it to Python.</p>
<p>First, let’s load some data into R. Sticking to the reptilian theme we’ve got going here, the data are taken from <a href="http://www.reptile-database.org/">The Reptile Database</a> (accessed August 31 2022), an open and freely available catalog of reptile species and their scientific classifications.<sup>9</sup></p>

<p>Currently this object is stored in-memory as an R data frame and we want to move it to Python. However, because Python data structures are different from R data structures, what this actually requires us to do is make a copy of the whole data set inside Python, using a Python-native data structure (in this case a Pandas DataFrame). Thankfully, reticulate does this seamlessly with the <code>r_to_py()</code> function:</p>

<p>Within the Python session, an object called <code>r</code> has been created: the Pandas DataFrame object is stored as <code>r.py_taxa</code>, and we can manipulate it using Python code in whatever fashion we normally might.</p>
<p>It helps to see a concrete example. To keep things simple, let’s pop over to our Python session and give ourselves a simple data wrangling task. Our goal is to count the number of entries in the data set for each reptilian family using Pandas syntax:</p>

<p>Naturally I could have done this in R using dplyr functions, but that’s not the point of the post. What matters for our purposes is that <code>counts</code> is a Pandas DataFrame that now exists in the Python session, which we would like to pull back into our R session.</p>
<p>This turns out to be easier than I was expecting. The reticulate package exposes an object named <code>py</code> to the user, and any objects I created in my Python session can be accessed that way:</p>

<p>What’s especially neat is that the data structure has been automatically translated for us: the <code>counts</code> object in Python is a Pandas DataFrame, but when accessed from R it is automatically translated into a native R data structure: <code>py$counts</code> is a regular data frame:</p>

<p>So far we have not touched Arrow, and you might be wondering if it’s even necessary to do so given that reticulate seems so smooth and seamless. Appearances can be a little deceiving however. The example from the last section only looks smooth and seamless because the data set is small. As I’ll show later in the post, cracks in the facade start to appear when you have to pass large data sets across languages. This happens for the very simple reason that a Pandas DataFrame is a different <em>thing</em> to an R data frame. It’s not possible for the two languages to share a single copy of the same data object because they don’t agree on what constitutes “a data object”. The only way we can do the handover is to make a copy of the data set and convert it to a format more suitable to the destination language. When the data set is small, this is not a problem. But as your data set grows, this becomes ever more burdensome. These copy-and-convert operations are not cheap.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if R and Python could both agree to represent the data as, oh let’s say…. an Arrow Table? On the R side we could interact with it using the arrow R package, and on the Python side we could interact with it using the pyarrow module. But regardless of which language we’re using, the thing in memory would be <em>exactly</em> the same… handing over the data set from one language to the other would no longer require any copying. A little metadata would change hands, and that’s all.</p>
<p>That sounds much nicer.</p>

But in any case, it’s usually pretty straightfoward: you can install the arrow R package from CRAN in the usual way using <code>install.packages("arrow")</code> and then load it in the usual fashion:</p>

<p>After all that set up, it’s almost comically easy to do the transfer itself. It’s literally the same as last time: we call <code>r_to_py()</code>. The <code>taxa_arrow</code> variable refers to an Arrow Table on the R side, so now all I have to do is use <code>r_to_py()</code> to create <code>py_taxa_arrow</code>, a variable that refers to the same Arrow Table from the Python side:</p>

<p>The output is formatted slightly differently because the Python pyarrow library is now doing the work. You can see from the first line that this is a <em>pyarrow</em> Table, but nevertheless when you look at the rest of the output it’s pretty clear that this is the same table.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="does-arrow-really-make-a-big-difference">Does Arrow really make a big difference?</h2>
<p>At the end of all this, you might want to know if using Arrow makes much of a difference. As much as I love learning new things for the sheer joy of learning new things, I prefer to learn useful things when I can! So let’s do a little comparison. First, I’ll define a <code>handover_time()</code> function that takes two arguments. The first argument <code>n</code> specifies the number of rows in the to-be-transferred data set. The second argument <code>arrow</code> is a logical value: setting <code>arrow = FALSE</code> means that an R data frame will be passed to Python as a Panda DataFrame, wheras <code>arrow = TRUE</code> means that an Arrow Table in R will be passed to Python and remain an Arrow Table. The actual data set is constructed by randomly sampling <code>n</code> rows from the <code>taxa</code> data set (with replacement):</p>

<p>Okay yeah. I’ll be the first to admit that this isn’t a very sophisticated way to do benchmarking, but when the difference is this stark you really don’t have to be sophisticated. Without Arrow, the only way to hand data from R to Python is to copy and convert the data, and that’s time consuming. The time cost gets worse the larger your data set becomes. With Arrow, the problem goes away because you’re not copying the data at all. The time cost is tiny and it stays tiny even as the data set gets bigger.</p>
<p>Seems handy to me?</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>Something to note here is that the reticulate solution implicitly assumes R is your “primary” language and Python is the “secondary” language. That is, reticulate is an R package that calls Python, not a Python module that calls R. Simularly, this quarto document uses the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html">knitr engine</a> (also an R package) to integrate code from the two languages. Yes the tools are multi-language, but the setup is pretty R-centric. Arguably this is typical for how an R user would set up a multi-language project, and since R is my primary language it’s my preferred solution. However, it’s not a particularly Pythonic way of approaching the problem. But fear not, Python fans. In the next post I’m going to describe an approach that solves the same problem in a Python-centric way.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Okay, in the spirit of total honesty… when I first started using reticulate I actually did let reticulate install its own version of Miniconda and everything was a total mess there for a while. My bash profile was set to find my original version of Miniconda, but reticulate was configured to look for the version it had installed. Hijinx ensued. As amusing as that little episode was, I’m much happier now that reticulate and bash are in agreement as to where Miniconda lives.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>The easiest way to edit this file, if you don’t already know how, is to call <code>usethis::edit_r_environ()</code> at the R console.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Well, all the Conda environments anyway↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>You can also use <code>conda_install()</code> to install into an existing conda environment.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Okay, I should unpack a little. This blog is written using quarto, and in this post I’m using knitr as the engine to power the evaluation of code chunks. The knitr R package relies on reticulate when it needs to execute Python code. What that means is that code chunks labelled “Python code” in this post are <em>implicitly</em> executed using the same interface (reticulate) as the examples that I am <em>explicitly</em> calling when some of my “R code” chunks use reticulate in a more obvious way. When I call <code>use_miniconda()</code> here it specifies the Python environment used by reticulate in this R session, irrespective of which “path” I use. In other words, the “Python code” chunks and the explicit calls to reticulate functions are all executed with the same Python environment (reptilia) because they occur within the same R session.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>As an aside it’s worth noting that reticulate exports an object called <code>py</code>, from which Python objects can be accessed: the <code>sys</code> object can also be referred to as <code>py$sys</code>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Note that the website does not explicitly specify a particular licence, but <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352462027_A_Quarter_Century_of_Reptile_and_Amphibian_Databases">journal articles documenting the database</a> written by the maintainers do refer to it as “open and freely available”. With that in mind I take it that the use of the data in this post is permitted. Naturally, should I discover that it is not I’ll immediately remove it!↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>As an aside – because I’m on on linux and life on linux is dark and full of terrors – this didn’t actually work for me the first time I tried it, and naturally I was filled with despair. Instead, I received this: <code>libstdc++.so.6: version 'GLIBCXX_3.4.22' not found</code>. As usual, googling the error message solved the problem. I updated with <code>sudo apt-get install libstdc++6</code>, and another catastrophe was thereby averted by copy/pasting into a search engine 🙃↩︎</p></li>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p>One peculiar feature of earning one’s keep in society by writing a data science blog is that it provides the opportunity to be unabashedly weird. Personality is important. Other developers will read your strange content – no matter how weird and unprofessional it is – because professional corporate style is very nearly as dull as academic writing, and it is a relief to learn a new thing from an actual human being who write with a certain level of human character.</p>
<p>Even if she is an irredeemably catty bitch.</p>
<p>All of which is by way of preamble, and a way to acknowlege that when the topic is package dependencies in R, the queer double entendres kind of write themselves.<sup>1</sup> And so without further ado, today’s unhinged rambling…</p>
<section id="managing-package-dependencies-in-r" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="managing-package-dependencies-in-r">Managing package dependencies in R</h2>
<p>Okay so you’ve done your due diligence. You’ve read his pkgdown site, checked out his repo, and you still like him. You really, <em>really</em> want to install his package. You’ve inspected the documentation and it is a very impressive package. I mean, I get it babe.</p>
<p>I. have. been. there.</p>
<p>There’s a thing with packages though. When you’re installing them into wherever you like to put packages (the precise location doesn’t matter for this post<sup>2</sup>), what you see isn’t necessarily all you get.</p>
<p>I’ll give a concrete example. For reasons unknown even to me I woke up this morning and decided today was the day I’d explore the <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/rig">rig installation manager</a> for R that lets you manage multiple R installations on the one machine. It’s very nice, and possibly the topic for a future post. However, one side consequence to adopting rig is that I ended up with adorably fresh copies of R that had no installed packages and needed to be properly set up. In the process, I started thinking a little about the tools I use to install packages. When I first started using R my go to method was to use the <code>install.packages()</code> function supplied by the utils package: after all, it comes bundled with R, which makes it an easy place to start. As I matured as an R user I found myself switching to the <a href="https://remotes.r-lib.org/">remotes package</a> because it provides a coherent set of functions for installing packages from CRAN, Bioconductor, GitHub, and more. I’m a huge fan of remotes, but for reasons I’ll explain in a moment I’m starting to prefer the <a href="https://pak.r-lib.org/">pak package</a> developed by Gábor Csárdi and Jim Hester. When using pak, the function you use to install packages is called <code>pkg_install()</code>. I’ll walk you through it. Here’s what happens when I try to install the <a href="https://quarto-dev.github.io/quarto-r/">quarto R package</a> without properly configuring my setup. First I call the function:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb1-1">pak<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">pkg_install</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"quarto"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>When I hit enter, pak starts doing its job, resolving the R dependencies and then asking if I want to continue:</p>
<pre><code>✓ Loading metadata database ... done
                                                                            
→ Will install 2 packages.
→ Will update 1 package.
→ Will download 3 packages with unknown size.
+ packrat         0.8.1  [bld][dl]
+ quarto    1.1 → 1.2    [bld][dl]
+ rsconnect       0.8.27 [bld][dl]
? Do you want to continue (Y/n) </code></pre>
<p>I really like this approach. The interface is very clear about precisely what is happening, and pak doesn’t download any more packages than is absolutely necessary to give you what you asked for (unless you specify <code>upgrade = TRUE</code> in the install command).</p>
<p>I agree to continue, so off pak goes, fetching the appropriate R packages:</p>
<pre><code>ℹ Getting 3 pkgs with unknown sizes
✓ Got quarto 1.2 (source) (67.58 kB)                                             
✓ Got rsconnect 0.8.27 (source) (685.57 kB)                                      
✓ Got packrat 0.8.1 (source) (681.50 kB)                                         
✓ Downloaded 3 packages (1.43 MB)in 6.7s</code></pre>
<p>So far, so good. The output is informative and succinct at the same time. It appeals to my aesthetic sensibilities. But then pak – which is very diligent about managing all dependencies including system dependencies – attempts to install the external libraries upon which quarto depends,<sup>3</sup> and this happens:</p>
<pre><code>ℹ Installing system requirements
ℹ Executing `sudo sh -c apt-get install -y make`
Error: System command 'sudo' failed, exit status: 1, stdout + stderr:
E&gt; sudo: a terminal is required to read the password; either use the -S option to read from standard input or configure an askpass helper</code></pre>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p><br><br></p>
</section>
<section id="what-went-wrong-here" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-went-wrong-here">What went wrong here?</h2>
<p>An important thing to understand here is that neither pak nor <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/">sudo</a> are to blame for the installation failure.<sup>4</sup> On the pak side, it’s a <em>good</em> thing that it tries to uncover and install system dependencies: the package isn’t going to work if you don’t have those dependencies installed, and it can be a nightmare trying to track them all down when the package manager doesn’t help identify them for you.<sup>5</sup> On the sudo side, it is extremely reasonable to expect the user to authenticate <em>before</em> enabling superuser privileges. Speaking for myself, I have a very strong expectation that I will be explicitly asked for my consent before packages are installed on my system.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>The breakdown happens because pak has invoked sudo outside of the terminal context. If you haven’t configured sudo to handle this situation, there’s no opportunity for the user to authenticate, and sudo throws an error.</p>
<p>How can we resolve this?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
</section>
<section id="configuring-sudo" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="configuring-sudo">Configuring sudo</h2>
<p>A little bit of digging revealed that sudo is a lot more configurable than I had preciously realised, and you can deal with this issue in a few different ways. One possibility would be to <a href="https://www.simplified.guide/linux/enable-passwordless-sudo">enable passwordless sudo</a>, in which case the system dependencies would be installed without requiring a password at all. That would certainly minimise the amount of hassle at my end, but it’s also a hell of a security risk. Even if I personally felt willing to take that risk with my own property, this is a work laptop and I think a little risk-aversion is a good idea in this case.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Fortunately, the error message itself contains some hints that there is an alternative fix that doesn’t require you to weaken your security settings (or not by very much, at any rate). Specifically, the error message refers to an “askpass helper”: a program, usually with a GUI, that sudo will invoke whenever it needs authentication from the user but is not running in a terminal. However, in order to get sudo to invoke one of these helpers, you have to explicitly configure it within the sudo configuration file, <code>sudo.conf</code>. This configuration file is located at <code>/etc/sudo.conf</code> is discussed pretty thoroughly in the sudo help documentation. Here’s the relevant part of the output when I type <code>man sudo.conf</code>:<sup>8</sup></p>
<div class="pre">
<pre><code> askpass   The fully qualified path to a helper program used to read the
           user's password when no terminal is available.  This may be
           the case when sudo is executed from a graphical (as opposed to
           text-based) application.  The program specified by askpass
           should display the argument passed to it as the prompt and
           write the user's password to the standard output.  The value
           of askpass may be overridden by the SUDO_ASKPASS environment
           variable.</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Okay, so I need to do two things. I need to edit <code>sudo.conf</code> to configure sudo to use the askpass helper, and I also need the askpass helper itself. So where do I find one of these askpass helper programs? The one I chose to go with is <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-askpass.1">ssh-askpass</a>, which I installed on my system using the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">sudo</span> apt-get install ssh-askpass ssh-askpass-gnome</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Notice that I installed both ssh-askpass and <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/testing/ssh-askpass-gnome/gnome-ssh-askpass.1.en.html">ssh-askpass-gnome</a>. The latter isn’t the askpass helper itself, and isn’t intended to be invoked separately from ssh-askpass. Rather it’s there because ssh-askpass on its own uses <a href="https://x.org/wiki/">X11</a> to do the graphical user interface part and it’s not very pretty on my Ubuntu installation. By installing ssh-askpass-gnome as well, the dialog box that comes up when ssh-askpass is invoked is much nicer.</p>
<p>At the terminal, I can invoke ssh-askpass manually if I want to. It doesn’t do much by itself: all it does is create the dialog box and return the text input by the user.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">ssh-askpass</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In practice you don’t actually call this directly. Instead, you configure sudo to that whenever it needs authentication but doesn’t have access to a terminal. In order to accomplish this, here’s the lines I added to my sudo.conf file:<sup>9</sup></p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb8-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;"># specify ssh-askpass as my helper</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">Path</span> askpass /usr/bin/ssh-askpass</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So I did this and then<sup>10</sup> tried to install quarto using <code>pkg_install()</code>. This time around sudo no longer errored when pak tried to install system dependencies. Instead it brought up the askpass dialog box:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-09-04_sudo-askpass/img/askpass-screen.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>When I typed in my password, pak and sudo were able to play nicely together and the installation worked just fine. Well, mostly..</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-we-relax-just-a-little-sweetie">Can we relax just a little sweetie?</h2>
<p>The only problem is that quarto installation requires <em>five</em> system dependencies to be installed, and as the output below shows, pak starts a new shell process every single time…</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb9-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">ℹ</span> Executing <span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">`</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">sudo</span> sh <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-c</span> apt-get install <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-y</span> make<span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">`</span></span>

<p>…and as a consequence of this I had to enter my password five times.</p>
<p>That’s mildly irritating, and I was not expecting it. My original assumption would be that entering the password the first time would invoke the sudo password cache: that is, after entering my password once, the elevated permissions<sup>11</sup> would persist for about 15 minutes. That’s what happens by default at the terminal, and I had presumed the same would apply when the call to sudo occurs within an R session. However, that’s not <em>quite</em> accurate. This little gem in <code>man sudo</code> explains the relevant security policy issue:</p>
<pre><code>     Security policies may support credential caching to allow the
     user to run sudo again for a period of time without requiring
     authentication.  By default, the sudoers policy caches creden‐
     tials on a per-terminal basis for 15 minutes.  See the
     timestamp_type and timestamp_timeout options in sudoers(5) for
     more information.  By running sudo with the -v option, a user
     can update the cached credentials without running a command.
</code></pre>
<p>The reason why the “15 minutes” rule doesn’t apply here is that the credentials are cached on a “per-terminal” basis. Each <code>sudo sh</code> command invoked by pak effectively runs a new instance of the shell and the password caching doesn’t transfer. Gr.</p>
</section>
<section id="editing-the-sudoers-file" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="editing-the-sudoers-file">Editing the sudoers file</h2>
<p>As a general rule I can understand why sudo is conservative and does not permit the credential cache to transfer across processes. Who knows what other processes are running and what they might be doing? But in this instance I’m willing to slightly relax the security policy to ensure that the pak/sudo combination doesn’t drive me crazy by relentlessly asking for permission on every little thing.</p>
<p>The security policies in sudo are managed by plugins<sup>12</sup> configured using the “sudoers” file(s) located at <code>/etc/sudoers</code>. I’ll talk about this file momentarily, but first here’s the relevant extract from <code>man sudoers</code> that tells us what setting we need to modify:</p>
<pre><code>     timestamp_type    sudoers uses per-user time stamp files for
                       credential caching.  The timestamp_type op‐
                       tion can be used to specify the type of time
                       stamp record used.  It has the following
                       possible values:

                       global  A single time stamp record is used
                               for all of a user's login sessions,
                               regardless of the terminal or parent
                               process ID.  An additional record is
                               used to serialize password prompts
                               when sudo is used multiple times in
                               a pipeline, but this does not affect
                               authentication.

                       ppid    A single time stamp record is used
                               for all processes with the same par‐
                               ent process ID (usually the shell).
                               Commands run from the same shell (or
                               other common parent process) will
                               not require a password for
                               timestamp_timeout minutes (15 by
                               default).  Commands run via sudo
                               with a different parent process ID,
                               for example from a shell script,
                               will be authenticated separately.

                       tty     One time stamp record is used for
                               each terminal, which means that a
                               user's login sessions are authenti‐
                               cated separately.  If no terminal is
                               present, the behavior is the same as
                               ppid.  Commands run from the same
                               terminal will not require a password
                               for timestamp_timeout minutes (15 by
                               default).

                       kernel  The time stamp is stored in the ker‐
                               nel as an attribute of the terminal
                               device.  If no terminal is present,
                               the behavior is the same as ppid.
                               Negative timestamp_timeout values
                               are not supported and positive val‐
                               ues are limited to a maximum of 60
                               minutes.  This is currently only
                               supported on OpenBSD.

                       The default value is tty.

                       This setting is only supported by version
                       1.8.21 or higher.
</code></pre>
<p>This documentation makes clear where the problem lies. When pak invokes sudo, a new process is spawned and unless the value of <code>timestamp_type</code> is set to <code>global</code>, the sudo credential cache doesn’t get shared across processes.</p>
<p>It’s possible to modify this setting, and I’ll show you how to do that below, but first I strongly recommend that you read this article on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-edit-the-sudoers-file">how to edit the sudoers file</a> carefully. <em>For realsies, my dears, read it</em>. Editing policies for sudo needs to be done with a lot of care. You don’t want to mess it up and lose the ability to invoke sudo because it’s been incorrectly configured. So please, please read the linked page.</p>
<p>You read it, right?</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>After reading through the linked article, I made the decision that instead of editing the main sudoers file, I would instead add a small file to the <code>/etc/sudoers.d/</code> directory. By default, files in this folder are automatically included when the sudoers plugin is loaded, so it’s a convenient place to add your customisations rather than editing the main file. I created one that exists solely to manage the timestamp settings for my primary user:</p>
<pre><code>sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/timestamp_type</code></pre>
<p>Notice that I’ve used <a href="https://www.sudo.ws/docs/man/1.8.13/visudo.man/">visudo</a>, and not some other editor. If you read the linked article you know why I did that, and why it is astonishingly important to do it this way in order to practice safe sudo<sup>13</sup> policy editing. If you didn’t read the linked article… well, you would be <em>extremely</em> ill-advised to try the next step without actually reading it.</p>
<p>Okay, that feels like enough warning. Let’s look at what I included in my new <code>/etc/sudoers.d/timestamp_type</code> file:</p>
<pre><code># specify the timeout type (usual default=tty)
Defaults:danielle timestamp_type=global

# specify the timeout interval (usual default=15)
Defaults:danielle timestamp_timeout=2</code></pre>
<p>I’ve done two things. First, in order to allow the sudo password cache to work everywhere regardless of which process invokes it, I set <code>timestamp_type=global</code>. Second, because this makes me a tiny bit nervous (it’s a very mild softening of security policies), I shortened the cache expiry time from 15 minutes to 2 minutes by setting <code>timestamp_timeout=2</code>. In practice, I very rarely do anything requiring superuser privileges that requires more than two minutes, and it seems best to let those privileges expire quickly.</p>

<p>At this point I have a set up that lets me use pak without needing to weaken my security policies (well, not by much) and won’t cause me to lose my mind by typing in my password over and over until I beg for the sweet release<sup>14</sup> of death. Was it all worth it?</p>
<p>Well, let me just say this: out of curiosity I decided to try installing the stars package, which necessarily entails installing a lot of geospatial dependencies. Back when I first tried installing these tools on linux a couple of years ago it was a nightmare. I had to track down the dependencies myself and manually install them, which was pretty daunting at the time because I was very new to the whole business.<sup>15</sup> Here’s what happened when I tried it with pak after configuring sudo to ask for my password only the once:</p>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p>It’s been a couple of months since I published anything on this blog. In my defence, I’ve been busy: I spent the month of June developing a workshop and website on <a href="https://arrow-user2022.netlify.app/">larger than memory workflows in R with Apache Arrow</a> for the useR! conference, and I spent July doing the same thing for my <a href="https://art-from-code.netlify.app/">art from code</a> workshop at rstudio::conf. But I am back to blogging now and I’m going to ease myself into it with a post that mixes some ideas from both of those workshops: how to use Arrow to assist in visualising large data sets. Specifically, I’m going to construct a map showing the geographic distribution of pickup locations for a billion or so taxi rides in New York.<sup>1</sup></p>

<section id="the-nyc-taxi-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-nyc-taxi-data">The NYC taxi data</h2>
<p>At this point in my life I have used the “NYC Taxi Data” for so many illustrative examples I feel like I don’t need to explain it: doesn’t “everyone” know about this data by now? Yeah, no dice sweetie. That’s a terrible intuition. Most people don’t know the data, and those that do can just skip to the next section! :-)</p>
<p>Here’s a quick summary of the data set. In its full form, the data set takes the form of one very large table with about 1.7 billion rows and 24 columns. Each row corresponds to a single taxi ride sometime between 2009 and 2022. There’s a complete <a href="https://arrow-user2022.netlify.app/packages-and-data.html#data">data dictionary for the NYC taxi data</a> on the useR workshop site, but the columns that will be relevant for us are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pickup_longitude</code> (double): Longitude data for the pickup location</li>
<li><code>pickup_latitude</code> (double): Latitude data for the pickup location</li>
<li><code>dropoff_longitude</code> (double): Longitude data for the dropoff location</li>
<li><code>dropoff_latitude</code> (double): Latitude data for the dropoff location</li>
</ul>
<p>On my laptop I have a copy of both the full data set, located at <code>"~/Datasets/nyc-taxi"</code> on my machine, and a much smaller “tiny” data set that contains 1 out of every 1000 records from the original, located at <code>"~/Datasets/nyc-taxi-tiny/"</code>. This tiny version has a mere 1.7 million rows of data, and as such is small enough that it will fit in memory. <a href="https://arrow-user2022.netlify.app/packages-and-data.html#data">Instructions for downloading both data sets</a> are available at the same location as the data dictionary.</p>

<section id="loading-the-data" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="loading-the-data">Loading the data</h2>
<p>Since I have local copies of the data, I’ll use the <code>open_dataset()</code> function from the {arrow} package to connect to both versions of the NYC taxi data:<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>If you’ve used <code>glimpse()</code> before this output will look very familiar. Each line in the output show the name of one column in the data, followed by the first few entries in that column.<sup>3</sup> However, when you look at the size of the data set, you might begin to suspect that some magic is going on. Behind the scenes there are 1.7 billion rows of data in one huge table, and this is just too big to load into memory. Fortunately, the {arrow} package allows us to work with it anyway!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="plotting-a-million-rows">Plotting a million rows</h2>
<p>Okay, let’s start with a data visualisation problem that wouldn’t be too difficult to manage on a small data set. I want to draw an image that plots the pickup location for every taxi ride in the data set. Here’s how I might go about that. First, I’ll do a minimal amount of data wrangling in {arrow}. Specifically, I’ll use the {dplyr} <code>select()</code> and <code>filter()</code> functions to limit the amount of data I have to <code>collect()</code> into R:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/filtering_105a395a3b69129b1deb402371e596aa">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">tic</span>()</span>

<span id="cb5-3">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">select</span>(pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude) <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>

<span id="cb5-5">    <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">!</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">is.na</span>(pickup_longitude),</span>
<span id="cb5-6">    <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">!</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">is.na</span>(pickup_latitude)</span>

<span id="cb5-9"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">toc</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>0.16 sec elapsed</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>At this point I have a regular R data frame, <code>nyc_pickups</code>, that contains only the data I need: the pickup locations for all those taxi rides (in the <em>tiny</em> taxi data set) that actually contain longitude and latitude data. Let’s use <code>glimpse()</code> again:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/glimpse-pickups_777a2e321317d21e8bd17c1d8b4b682e">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">glimpse</span>(nyc_pickups)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Rows: 1,249,107

</div>
</div>
<p>Compared to the full NYC taxi data, this is a relatively small data set. Drawing a scatter plot from 1.2 million observations isn’t a trivial task, to be sure, but it is achievable. In fact the {ggplot2} package handles this task surprisingly well:</p>

<p>It’s not lightning fast or anything, but it’s still pretty quick!</p>
<p>As neat as this visualisation is there are limitations.<sup>4</sup> In some parts of the plot – notably midtown in Manhattan – the data are so dense that you can’t make out any fine detail. In other parts – Brooklyn and Queens, for instance – there are so few data points that you can’t see much at all:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scaling-to-a-billion-rows">Scaling to a billion rows</h2>
<p>To make a better version of this plot, we’re going to have to do two things at once:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a lot more data. If we use the full NYC taxi data set, the visualisation will be a lot more detailed in areas where it is currently too sparse.</li>
<li>Show gradation at each location. In the dense areas there are too many points plotted atop one another. Instead of overplotting, we’ll use shading to represent the number of pickups at each location.</li>
</ul>
<p>How do we do this? Let’s say I want to create a 4000 x 4000 pixel image, and I want the “intensity” at each pixel to represent the number of pickups that fall in the geographic region spanned by that pixel. There are a total of 16 million pixels, so our task is to assign each of observation one of those those 16 million bins, and then count the number of observations in each bin. We’ll have to rely on Arrow to do all the heavy lifting here. This binning cannot be done natively in R: the data set is just too big. Even after filtering out missing and out-of-bounds data points, there are still 1.2 billion rows, and R can’t do that without assistance.</p>
<p>Here’s what the solution looks like:</p>

<p>This is a data frame where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> specify the pixel, and and a <code>pickup</code> counts the number of pickups associated with that pixel. Note that the pixels aren’t arranged in a meaningful order, and only those pixels with at least one pickup (a little under 30% of all pixels) are included in data.</p>
<p>We can visualise this in a number of ways. One possibility is to create a scatter plot, using the <code>pickup</code> value to specify the shading of each plot marker:</p>

<p>As you can see, {ggplot2} has no problems drawing a scatter plot from a few million observations, and it’s an improvement on our first attempt. However, we can do better. Instead of trying to draw a scatter plot of all the points listed in the <code>pickup</code> data frame, let’s use it to populate a bitmap. We’ll create a 4000x4000 matrix, and fill in the cells with the pickup counts at the corresponding pixel.</p>
<p>The computation is a two part process. First, we use <code>expand_grid()</code> to initialise a “grid like” tibble containing all combination of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values, and use <code>left_join()</code> to populate a column containing the <code>pickup</code> counts:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Because the elements of <code>grid$pickup</code> are arranged in this fashion, it is easy to construct the required 4000x4000 matrix:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb23" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb23-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">tic</span>()</span>

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

</div>
</div>
<p>This is our bitmap. It’s a matrix whose values correspond to the pixel intensities to be plotted. Just so you can see what it looks like, here’s a tiny 10x10 pixel section from that matrix:</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>Now that the data are in an image-like format, all we have to do is write the image file. We don’t even need {ggplot2}: we can use <code>image()</code> to draw the bitmap directly. Here’s a little helper function I wrote to do this:</p>

<p>Here’s what happens when I call it:</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>This method is slightly faster the previous version, but the real advantage isn’t speed – it’s clarity. There’s less blurring in the denser parts of the plot (midtown Manhattan), and there’s also more clarity in the sparser areas (e.g., the Brooklyn streets are sharper).</p>
<p>We can push it slightly further by tweaking the colour palette. Plotting the logarithm of the number of pickups ensures that all the streets are visible (not just the extremely common ones), but it does have the downside that it’s hard to tell the difference between moderately popular pickup locations and extremely popular ones. A well-chosen diverging palette helps rectify this a little:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb31" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb31-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">render_image</span>(pickup_grid, <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">cols =</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">c</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"#002222"</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"white"</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"#800020"</span>))</span></code></pre></div>

</div>
</div>
<p>At long last we have a visualisation that shows all the billion rows of data, crisply delineates all the streets on which taxi pickups are at least moderately frequent, <em>and</em> does a reasonable job of highlighting those locations where taxi pickups are extremely common. Yay! 🎉</p>

<section id="lessons-learned" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned?</h2>
<p>To wrap this post up, I think it’s useful to reflect on the process I went through in constructing this image. In one sense, the process I’ve gone through here isn’t actually much different to what we do when creating any other data visualisation in R. For example, if you’re working in {tidyverse}, a typical work flow is to use {dplyr} to wrangle the data into an appropriate format and then use {ggplot2} to plot the data. What I’ve done here isn’t that different: okay yes, my {dplyr} code only works because it’s backed by the {arrow} engine, and in the end I decided to use base graphics rather than {ggplot2} to draw the final image, but I don’t think those differences constitute a major departure from my usual approach.</p>
<p>That being said, I think there are two key principles I’ve taken away from this. When trying to visualise very large data sets in R, the things I’m going to try to keep in mind are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Push as much of the computational work onto {arrow} as possible. The {arrow} package is designed specifically to handle these kinds of data manipulation problems, and things go much more smoothly when I don’t make {ggplot2} do the computational heavy lifting.</p></li>
<li><p>Think carefully about the data representation. The reason why the final plot drawn with <code>image()</code> is nicer than the earlier ones drawn with {ggplot2} has nothing at all to do with the “base R vs tidyverse” issue. Instead, it’s because the data structure I created (i.e., <code>pickup_grid</code>) is the exact bitmap that needed to be rendered, and that’s exactly what <code>image()</code> is good for.</p></li>
</ul>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>My catholic taste in the devil<br>
All gilded and golden, yes, I’m your girl<br>
Hell, if it glitters, I’m going<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;– <em>Heaven is Here</em>, Florence + The Machine</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’ve made the life choice to become a developer advocate with a focus on <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/">Apache Arrow</a>, you’re probably not unfamiliar with masochism.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me? Let’s consider my past choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>My first attempt to write about the topic didn’t even talk about Arrow: the post was a descent into the madness of <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2021-11-15_serialisation-with-rds/">data serialisation in R</a> and the RDS format. I don’t think I need to explain the pain that one involved.</li>
<li>My second attempt went a little better, and I managed to write a few thousand words on <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2021-11-19_starting-apache-arrow-in-r/">getting started with Apache Arrow</a> for the R user. Much of that post was spent on answering very technical questions like “what is this?” and “why do I care?” These are excellent questions to answer, but nevertheless it was a learning experience for me, shall we say? There were headaches.</li>
<li>My third attempt talked about how <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-01-18_binding-arrow-to-r/">the <strong>arrow</strong> package supplies <strong>dplyr</strong> bindings</a>, allowing R to perform data manipulation on Arrow data using familiar <strong>dplyr</strong> syntax. It wasn’t a bad post to be honest, but I did go down a very strange path with all the <em>Magicians</em> gifs and as anyone familiar with the series knows, the magic comes from pain.</li>
<li>As for my fourth attempt, the <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-03-04_data-types-in-arrow-and-r/">data types in Arrow and R</a> post… look, if you’ve ever had a secret desire to see what happens when I am reduced to tears and wailing at the horrors of the world and of IEEE 754, then oh my yes, this is the extremely long blog post for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t regret any of these choices, particularly the fact that they have helped keep me gainfully employed, but there’s no denying the fact that a lot of blood and tears have been spilled in the endeavour.</p>
<p>In any case, what I am trying to convey to you, dear reader, is that – setting aside the superficial trappings of whips and chains and the various other devices that propelled E. L. James to great fortune – I am intimately acquainted with pain. It is important to me that you understand this, and that when I mention the pain I encountered when trying to learn how the <strong>arrow</strong> R package works, I am not using the term lightly.</p>
<p>So let talk about my latest pain point, shall we?</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<section id="data-objects" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-objects">Data objects</h2>
<p>Here’s the thing that has been giving me grief. Suppose you are an R user who is new to this whole Apache Arrow business. You’ve installed the <strong>arrow</strong> package, and you’re now reading the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/arrow.html">Get Started</a> page in the hopes that you too will be able to, well, get started. When you visit this page, one of the very first things you encounter is a table listing a variety of data structures used by Arrow. Specifically, the table tells you that Arrow has classes for zero-dimensional data (scalars), one-dimensional data (arrays and other vector-like data), and two-dimensional data (tabular or data frame-like data). It shows you that…</p>
<p>…actually, you know what? Instead of describing it, let’s take a look at the actual table. Here’s what it tells you about the hierarchy of data structures in <strong>arrow</strong>:</p>
<p><br></p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 1%">
<col style="width: 8%">
<col style="width: 25%">
<col style="width: 63%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Dim</th>
<th>Class</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>How to create an instance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>0</td>
<td><code>Scalar</code></td>
<td>single value and its <code>DataType</code></td>
<td><code>Scalar$create(value, type)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>1</td>
<td><code>Array</code></td>
<td>vector of values and its <code>DataType</code></td>
<td><code>Array$create(vector, type)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td><code>ChunkedArray</code></td>
<td>vectors of values and their <code>DataType</code></td>
<td><code>ChunkedArray$create(..., type)</code> or alias <code>chunked_array(..., type)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td><code>RecordBatch</code></td>
<td>list of <code>Array</code>s with a <code>Schema</code></td>
<td><code>RecordBatch$create(...)</code> or alias <code>record_batch(...)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2</td>
<td><code>Table</code></td>
<td>list of <code>ChunkedArray</code> with a <code>Schema</code></td>
<td><code>Table$create(...)</code>, alias <code>arrow_table(...)</code>, or <code>arrow::read_*(file, as_data_frame = FALSE)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td><code>Dataset</code></td>
<td>list of <code>Table</code>s with the same <code>Schema</code></td>
<td><code>Dataset$create(sources, schema)</code> or alias <code>open_dataset(sources, schema)</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br></p>
<p>Now, perhaps there are some devilishly clever R users who can look at this table and immediately decode all its mysteries. But I will be honest with you, and confess that I am not one of these people. When I first started learning Arrow, I had no idea what any of this meant. This whole table was completely intimidating. I looked at it and thoughts roughly along the following lines went through my head:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Oh… f**k me. I’m completely out of my depth, I am too stupid to understand any of this. I should quit now and find a new job before everyone realises I’m a total fraud. They made a terrible mistake hiring me and… blah blah blah</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The self-pity went on for a while and the names I called myself became quite inappropriate for a family restaurant, but I’ll be kind and spare you the tiresome details.</p>
<p>Eventually I remembered that this is my impostor syndrome talking and that I am in fact quite good at learning technical concepts. The problem I’m encountering here is that this table isn’t self-explanatory, and isn’t accompanied by the explanatory scaffolding that helps new users orient themselves. That’s a documentation issue, not a user problem. At a later point someone<sup>1</sup> might need to add a few explanatory paragraphs and probably a vignette to ensure that new Arrow users don’t get confused at this point, but for now let’s see if we can’t unpack it here?</p>
<p>Looking at this table, a new user might have some very reasonable questions. What exactly is a <code>ChunkedArray</code> and how is it different from an <code>Array</code>? Why are these necessary as distinct concepts? While we are at it, what is a <code>RecordBatch</code>, a <code>Table</code> and a <code>Dataset</code>, and what makes them different from one another? Unless someone takes the time to explain it all to you, it does look like Arrow is unnecessarily complicated, doesn’t it? These are core concepts in Arrow, but new users don’t know what they are yet!</p>
<p>In short, the time has come to tell the story behind this table. With that in mind, I’ll go through this table row by row and talk about what each line actually means.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Adventure!</p>
<p>Romance!</p>
<p>Drama!</p>
<p>Joy!</p>
<p>I am absolutely not going to deliver any of those things, but hopefully this will be useful.</p>

<p>Let’s start with scalars. A scalar object is simply a single value, that can be of any type. It might be an integer, a string, a timestamp, or any of the different data types that Arrow supports. I won’t talk about the different types in this post because I already wrote <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-03-04_data-types-in-arrow-and-r/">an extremely long post on that topic</a>. For the current purposes, what matters is that a scalar is <em>one</em> value. It is “zero dimensional”. All higher order data structures are built on top of scalars, so they are in some sense fundamental, but there is not much I need to say about them for this post. For the record though, you can create a scalar using <code>Scalar$create()</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1">Scalar<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">create</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"hi"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

<p>Oh the excitement. I can barely contain myself.</p>

<p>Okay, so scalars aren’t very interesting for the purposes of this post. Let’s turn our attention to arrays next. An array is roughly analogous to a vector in R, and the <strong>arrow</strong> package is written in a way that allows you to interact with Arrow arrays in ways that feel familiar to R users.</p>
<p>I can create an array using <code>Array$create()</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1">arr <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> Array<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">create</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">c</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"hello"</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"cruel"</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"world"</span>))</span>
<span id="cb4-2">arr</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Array
&lt;string&gt;
[
  "hello",
  "cruel",
  "world"
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>I can create a subset of an array using square brackets:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb6-1">arr[<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">2</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">3</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Array
&lt;string&gt;
[
  "cruel",
  "world"
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice that I used <code>2:3</code> here to extract the 2nd and 3rd elements of the array. Unlike R, Arrow uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-based_numbering">zero-based indexing</a>, so if I were writing this using “Arrow native” code, the relevant subset would be <code>1:2</code>. However, as a general principle, <strong>arrow</strong> tries to make Arrow data structures behave like R native objects. The design principle here is that you should be able to use your usual R code to manipulate Arrow data objects, without needing to think too much about the Arrow implementation.</p>
<p>I’m stressing the principle now because later in this post I am going to violate it!</p>
<p>Because one of the other things <strong>arrow</strong> does is expose a low-level interface to Arrow. You don’t need to use this (and in general you don’t really need to), but it’s there if you want it, and because this post explores the R/Arrow interface I am going to use it sometimes. When that happens, you’ll start to see zero-based indexing appear! I promise I will signpost this every time it happens so you aren’t caught unawares.</p>
<p><br></p>
<section id="structure-of-arrays" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structure-of-arrays">Structure of arrays</h3>
<p>Anyway, as I was saying, an array in Arrow is analogous to a vector in R: it is a sequence of values with known length, all of which have the same type. When you’re using the <strong>arrow</strong> package on a day-to-day basis, you really don’t need to know much more than that. But if you want to understand data objects in Arrow properly, it helps to do a slightly deeper dive. All the low level details are described on the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html">Arrow specification</a> page, but the full specification is a little overwhelming when you’re first starting out. I’ll start by introducing two key concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The data in an array are stored in one or more <strong>buffers</strong>. A buffer is a sequential virtual address space (i.e., block of memory) with a given length. As long as you have a pointer specifting the memory address for the buffer (i.e., where it starts), you can reach any byte in the buffer using an “offset” value that tells you the location of that byte relative to the start of the buffer.</li>
<li>The <strong>physical layout</strong> of an array is a term used to describe how data in an array is laid out in memory, without taking into account of how that information is interpreted. For example, a 32-bit signed integer and 32-bit floating point number have the same layout: they are both 32 bits, represented as 4 contiguous bytes in memory. The meaning is different, but the layout is the same. However, unlike simple scalars, an array can have a relatively complex layout, storing data and metadata in a structured arrangement.</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<section id="layouts-and-buffers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="layouts-and-buffers">Layouts and buffers</h4>
<p>Let’s unpack some of these ideas using a simple array of integer values:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb8-1">arr <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> Array<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">create</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">c</span>(1L, <span class="cn" style="color: #8f5902;">NA</span>, 2L, 4L, 8L))</span>
<span id="cb8-2">arr</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Array
&lt;int32&gt;
[
  1,
  null,
  2,
  4,
  8
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>What precisely is this thing? Well that’s a mess of different questions. In one sense, the answer is straightforward. It’s an Arrow array, and the values contained within the array are all stored as signed 32 bit integers:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb10" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb10-1">arr<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span>type</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Int32
int32</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>But that’s not a very satisfying answer at some level. What does this thing look like in memory? How is the information structured? In other words, what is the <strong>physical layout</strong> of this object?</p>
<p>The Arrow documentation page helps us answer that. Our array contains two pieces of metadata, namely the length of the array (i.e.&nbsp;5) and a count of the number of null values (i.e., 1), both of which are stored as 64-bit integers. The <strong>arrow</strong> package makes it easy to extract these values, because the Array object has fields and methods that will return them:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb12" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb12-1">arr<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">length</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] 5</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb14" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb14-1">arr<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span>null_count</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] 1</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Okay, that seems reasonable. What about the data itself? Where is that stored? In Arrow, these are stored within buffers, a contiguous block of memory assigned to the array. The number of buffers associated with an array depends on the exact type of data being stored. For an integer array such as <code>arr</code>, there are two buffers, a <strong>validity bitmap buffer</strong> and a <strong>data value buffer</strong>. So we have a data structure that could be depicted like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-05-25_arrays-and-tables-in-arrow/img/array_layout.svg" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this figure I’ve shown the array as a grey rectangle subdivided into two parts, one for the metadata and the other for the buffers. Underneath I’ve unpacked this it a little, showing the contents of the two buffers in the area enclosed in a dotted line. At the lowest level of the figure, you can see the contents of specific bytes. Notice that the numbering of the bytes starts at zero: I’m referring to Arrow data structures here, and Arrow is zero-indexed. Later in the post I’ll talk about how you can access the raw content of these buffers, but for now let’s talk about what each of these buffers contains.</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="the-validity-bitmap-buffer" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-validity-bitmap-buffer">The validity bitmap buffer</h4>
<p>The validity bitmap is binary-valued, and contains a 1 whenever the corresponding slot in the array contains a valid, non-null value. Setting aside some very tiresome technicalities we can imagine that the validity bitmap is a buffer that contains the following five bits:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb16" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode python code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb16-1"><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">10111</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Except… this isn’t really true, for three reasons. First, memory is allocated in byte-size units, so we have to pad it out to the full 8 bits. That gives us the bitmap <code>10111000</code>. Second, that’s still a little inaccurate because – assuming you read left to right – you’re looking it with the “most significant bit” first (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">big endian format</a>), and the bits are actually organised with the least significant bit first (i.e., little endian format) so the bits in this byte should be shown in the reverse order, <code>00011101</code>. Third, this is still misleading because I’ve not padded it enough. For reasons that make a lot of sense if you start diving into the Arrow specifications at a low level, you have to imagine another 503 trailing zeros.<sup>3</sup> So that the nice and neat <code>10111</code> I’ve shown above actually looks like this in memory:</p>
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-6">
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Byte 0 (validity bitmap)</th>
<th>Bytes 1-63</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>00011101</code></td>
<td><code>0</code> (padding)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p>I probably wouldn’t have gone into quite this much detail, except for the fact that you can find this exact example when reading about <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#fixed-size-primitive-layout">physical layouts</a> in the Arrow documentation, and I think it’s helpful to have a clear point of contact between this post and the documentation.</p>
<p>Anyway, I realise I’m being boring. So let’s move on.</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="the-data-value-buffer" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-data-value-buffer">The data value buffer</h4>
<p>Okay, now let’s have a look at the value buffer. It’s essentially the same logic. Again notice that its padded out to a length of 64 bytes to preserve natural alignment, but for our purposes those details don’t matter too much. Here’s the diagram showing the physical layout, again lifted straight from the Arrow specification page:</p>
<div class="grid">
<div class="g-col-12">
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 14%">
<col style="width: 17%">

<tr class="odd">
<td><code>1</code></td>
<td>unspecified</td>
<td><code>2</code></td>
<td><code>4</code></td>
<td><code>8</code></td>
<td>unspecified</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Each integer occupies 4 bytes, as required by the int32 data type. (If you want to know more about how Arrow represents integers, it’s discussed in the <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-03-04_data-types-in-arrow-and-r/#integer-types">data types</a> post).</p>

<!--
Just to give you a sense of what that looks like, I'll take a peek at the bits that make up the integer `8` (i.e., the contents of Bytes 16-19). I could do this using base R with a command like `intToBits(8L)` but the `bits()` function from the **pryr** package produces a more compact output so I'll do this:


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
pryr::bits(8L)
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}
```
[1] "00000000 00000000 00000000 00001000"
```
:::
:::


Or, to condense it even further, we can express each byte as a hexadecimal value. That's what the `pryr::bytes()` function does, so this is an equivalent way of writing out the content of those four bytes:


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
pryr::bytes(8L)
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}
```
[1] "00 00 00 08"
```
:::
:::


Putting all this together you can imagine -- roughly speaking -- what the contents of the data buffer should look like. Ignoring all the trailing bytes used for padding, and not worrying too much about what's going on with the command I've used to extract them, the 20 bytes worth of actual data in the data buffer look like this:


::: {.cell}

```{.r .cell-code}
arr$data()$buffers[[2]]$data()
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}
```
 [1] 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 02 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 08 00 00 00
```
:::
:::


Notice that the last four bytes shown are written `08 00 00 00` (little endian), whereas the bytes produced by `pryr::bytes()` are shown in the other direction. It's the same thing, just a different display convention! 

<br>

#### Um... summary please?

Okay, let's be honest. This section went down into the weeds a bit. I personally find it helpful to understand how all these concepts play out in terms of actual bits in memory, but it does get a bit much. So let's pull back and ask ourselves what matters here. For me, the big picture is this: an Arrow array is an immutable object with an "metadata + buffers" structure that is designed to be efficient, and each buffer is a contiguous bloc of memory on your machine.

<p>I mentioned earlier that <strong>arrow</strong> exposes some “low level” tools that allow you to interact with Arrow data objects in more of a bare bones fashion than a data analyst normally would. For example, you wouldn’t normally have a need to extract the raw bytes that comprise the buffers in an array. There’s no “high level” interface that lets you do this. But if you really want to see what’s going on under the hood you absolutely can, and <strong>arrow</strong> lets you do this. To show you how it works, I’ll uses a small data set containing the track listing for the new Florence + The Machine album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Fever_(album)">Dance Fever</a>:</p>

</div>
<p>I’ll start by taking the <code>duration</code> variable and creating an Arrow array from it:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb19" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb19-1">duration <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> Array<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">create</span>(dance_fever<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span>duration)</span>

</div>
<p>As a reminder, here’s a crude schematic diagram showing how that object is laid out. It has some metadata that you’ve already learned how to extract (e.g., using <code>duration$null_count</code>), and it has two data buffers that I talked about at tedious length but haven’t actually <em>shown</em> you yet:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">

</div>
</div>
<p>To take a more detailed look at the data stored in the <code>duration</code> object, we can call its <code>data()</code> method to return an <code>ArrayData</code> object. Admittedly, the results are not immediately very exciting:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb21" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb21-1">duration<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">data</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>ArrayData</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This output is a little underwhelming because at the moment the print method for an <code>ArrayData</code> object doesn’t do anything except print the class name. Boring! However, because an <code>ArrayData</code> object is stored as an R6 object, all the information is tucked away in an environment. We can find out the names of objects contained in that environment easily enough:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb23" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb23-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">names</span>(duration<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">data</span>())</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code> [1] ".__enclos_env__" "buffers"         "offset"          "null_count"

</div>
</div>
<p>Hm. There’s a <code>buffers</code> variable in there. I wonder what that is…</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb25" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb25-1">duration<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">data</span>()<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span>buffers</span></code></pre></div>

</div>
<p>Oh look, there are two buffers here! What’s the chance that the first one is the validity bitmap and the second one is the data buffer? (Answer: 100% chance). It turns out that this is another situation where a <code>Buffer</code> object belongs to an R6 class with a boring print method. I could bore you by going through the same process I did last time, but I’d rather not waste your time. It turns out that <code>Buffer</code> objects have a <code>data()</code> method of their own. When we call the <code>data()</code> method returns the bytes stored in the relevant buffer as a raw vector. At long last, we can pull out the raw bytes:</p>

<p>A little digression before we move on to talking about chunked arrays. Later in this post I’ll occasionally want to show you the internal structure of an array, just so you can see that the buffers and metadata have the values you’d expect them to. The information I need for this is stored in the <code>ArrayData</code> object returned by a command like <code>duration$data()</code> but as we saw in the last section there’s no convenient way to display these objects. To make this a little simpler, I wrote my own <code>array_layout()</code> function that shows you the metadata and buffer contents associated with an Arrow array – the source code is <a href="display_array_layout.R">here</a>) — that doesn’t work for all array types, but can handle the ones I’m using in this post. When applied to the <code>duration</code> array it produces this output:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb31" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb31-1">duration <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb31-2">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">array_layout</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stderr">

</div>
</div>
<p>The output here is divided into two sections, structured to mirror how the Arrow columnar specification is described on the website (and also to mirrot the diagrams in the post). There is one section showing the metadata variables stored: array length, and a count of the number of null values. Underneath that we have a section listing all the buffers associated with an array. For an integer array like <code>duration</code> there are two buffers, the validity bitmap buffer and the data values buffer.</p>
<p>The <code>array_layout()</code> function also works for string arrays and produces similar output. However, character data in Arrow are stored using three buffers rather than two. As before the first buffer stores the validity bitmap. The second buffer is a vector of offsets specifying the locations for each of the substrings. The third buffer contains the character data itself. Here’s an example of that:</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>If you want more information about how character data are stored in Arrow and how the offset buffer and data buffer are used to define the array as a whole, I wrote about it in tiresome detail in my <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-03-04_data-types-in-arrow-and-r/#character-types">data types post</a>. For the purposes of this post, it’s enough to understand that string arrays are organised using these three buffers.</p>

<p>The next entry in the table of data objects refers to “chunked arrays”. In most respects a chunked array behaves just like a regular array. It is a one-dimensional data structure. It requires every value stored to be of the same type: all integers, or all strings, or whatever. From the perspective of a <em>data scientist</em> who just wants to analyse the data, an array and a chunked array are essentially identical. Under the hood, however, they are quite different – and the reason for this is fundamentally a <em>data engineering</em> issue. In this section I’ll unpack this.</p>
<p>Recall at the beginning I emphasised that an array is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutable object</a>. Once an array has been created by Arrow, the values it stores cannot be altered. The decision to make arrays immutable reduces the need to create copies: many other objects can all safely refer to the array (via pointers) without making copies of the data, safe in the knowledge that it is impossible<sup>5</sup> for anyone else to change the data values. For large data sets that’s a huge advantage: you really don’t want to be making copies of data if you can avoid doing so. Immutable arrays are good.</p>
<p>Well, mostly good.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to immutable arrays, and one of the big ones is prompted by the very simple question: what happens when a new batch of data arrives? An array is immutable, so you can’t add the new information to an existing array. The only thing you can do if you don’t want to disturb or copy your existing array is create a new array that contains the new data. Doing that preserves the immutability of arrays and doesn’t lead to any unnecessary copying – which keeps us happy(ish) from a data engineering perspective – but now we have a new problem: the data are now split across two arrays. Each array contains only one “chunk” of the data. We need some way of “pretending” that these two arrays are in fact a single array-like object.</p>
<p>This is the problem that chunked arrays solve. A chunked array is a wrapper around a list of arrays, and allows you to index their contents “as if” they were a single array. Physically, the data are still stored in separate places – each array is one chunk, and these chunks don’t have to be adjacent to each other in memory – but the chunked array provides us will a layer of abstraction that allows us to pretend that they are all one thing.</p>

<p>Here’s an example. I’ll take some lyrics to <em>King</em> by Florence + The Machine, and use the <code>chunked_array()</code> function from <strong>arrow</strong> to store them as a chunked array that is comprised of three smaller arrays:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb35" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb35-1">king <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">chunked_array</span>(</span>

<span id="cb35-5">)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>An alternative way to do the same thing would be to use the <code>create()</code> method of the <a href="https://r6.r-lib.org/">R6 object</a> <code>ChunkedArray</code>. In fact, the <code>chunked_array()</code> function is just a slightly nicer wrapper around the same functionality that <code>ChunkedArray$create()</code> provides. But that’s a bit of a digression. Let’s take a look at the object I just created:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb36" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb36-1">king</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>ChunkedArray
[
  [
    "I",
    "am",
    "no",
    "mother"
  ],
  [

    "am",
    null,
    "bride"
  ],
  [
    "I",
    "am",
    "king"
  ]
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The double bracketing in this output is intended to highlight the “list-like” nature of chunked arrays. There are three separate arrays that I have created here, wrapped in a handly little container object that is secretly a list of arrays, but allows that list to behave just like a regular one-dimensional data structure. Schematically, this is what I’ve just created:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-05-25_arrays-and-tables-in-arrow/img/chunked_array_layout.svg" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As this figure illustrates, there really are three arrays here. I can pull them out individually by referring to their position in the array list by using the <code>chunk()</code> method that all chunked array objects possess. This is another one of those situations where I’m using a low-level feature, and the zero-based indexing in Arrow reappears. To extract the second chunk, here’s what I do:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb38" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb38-1">king<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">chunk</span>(<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Array
&lt;string&gt;
[
  "I",
  "am",
  null,
  "bride"
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice from the output that this chunk is a vanilla <code>Array</code> object, and I can take a peek at the underlying metadata and buffers associated with that object by using the <code>array_layout()</code> function I wrote earlier. Here’s what that chunk looks like:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb40" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb40-1">king<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">chunk</span>(<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span>) <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span> </span>
<span id="cb40-2">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">array_layout</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stderr">
<pre><code>
── Metadata 
• length : 4
• null count : 1

── Buffers 
• validity : 1 1 0 1
• offset : 0 1 3 3 8
• data : Iambride</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hopefully by now this all looks quite familiar to you! The <code>Array</code> object here has length 4, contains 1 missing value (referred to as null values in Arrow), and because it is a string array, it contains three buffers: a validity bitmap, an offset buffer, and a data buffer.</p>

<section id="vector-like-aspects" class="level3 page-columns page-full">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vector-like-aspects">Vector-like aspects</h3>
<p>In the previous section I highlighted the fact that internally a chunked array is “just” a list of arrays and showed you how you can interact with a chunked array in a “list-like” way. Most of the time though, when you’re working with a chunked array as a data analyst you aren’t really interested in its list-like properties, what you actually care about is the abstraction layer that provides it with vector-like properties. Specifically, what you actually care about is the fact that a chunked array is a one-dimensional object with a single indexing scheme. Let’s go back to the <code>king</code> data to illustrate this. Suppose I want to extract a subset of the elements. Specifically I want to grab the 3rd through 6th elements. These slots actually belong to different arrays, and it would be a pain to extract the 3rd and 4th slots from the first array, and the 1st and 2nd slots from the second array. No data analyst wants that headache. Fortunately, I don’t have to:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb42" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb42-1">king[<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">3</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">6</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>ChunkedArray
[
  [
    "no",
    "mother"
  ],
  [
    "I",
    "am"
  ]
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>As an R user you are probably breathing a sigh of relief to see the return of one-based indexing! Again I should stress that this is the norm: as a general rule, the <strong>arrow</strong> package tries to mimic R conventions whenever you are “just trying to do normal R things”. If you’re trying to manipulate and analyse data, the intention is that your regular <strong>dplyr</strong> functions should work the same way they always did, and the same goes for subsetting data. In R, the first element of a vector is element 1, not element 0, and that convention is preserved here. The only time you’re going to see <strong>arrow</strong> adopt zero-based indexing is when you are interacting with Arrow at a low level.</p>
<p>Another thing to highlight about chunked arrays is that the “chunking” is not considered semantically meaningful. It is an internal implementation detail only: you should never treat the chunk as a meaningful unit! Writing the data to disk, for example, often results in the data being organised into different chunks. Two arrays that have the same values in different chunking arrangements are deemed equivalent. For example, here’s the same four values as <code>king[3:6]</code> all grouped into a single chunk:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb44" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb44-1">no_mother <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">chunked_array</span>(<span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">c</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"no"</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"mother"</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"I"</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"am"</span>))</span>
<span id="cb44-2">no_mother</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>ChunkedArray
[
  [
    "no",
    "mother",
    "I",
    "am"
  ]
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>When I test for equality using <code>==</code>, you can see that the results are shown element-wise. All four elements are the same, so the result is a (chunked) array of four <code>true</code> values:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb46" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb46-1">no_mother <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">==</span> king[<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">3</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">6</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>ChunkedArray
[
  [
    true,
    true,
    true,
    true
  ]
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>The intention, ultimately, is that users should be able to interact with chunked arrays as if they were ordinary one-dimensional data structures without ever having to think much about their list-like nature. Chunked arrays exist as an abstraction to help bridge the gap between the needs of the data engineer and the needs of the data scientist. So except in those special cases where you have to think carefully about the engineering aspect, a data analyst should be able to treat them just like regular vectors!</p>

<section id="record-batches" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="record-batches">Record batches</h2>
<p>Now that we have a good understanding of zero dimensional data objects (scalars), and one dimensional data objects (arrays and chunked arrays), the time has come to make the jump into the second dimension and talk about tabular data structures in <strong>arrow</strong>. In the data objects table I presented at the start of the post there are three of these listed: record batches, tables, and datasets. Record batches are the simplest of the three so I’m going to start there, but in everyday data analysis you’re not likely to be using them very much: in practice tables and datasets are the things you’re likely to care about most. Even so, from a learning standpoint it really helps to have a good understanding of record batches because the other concepts are built on top of them.</p>
<p>A record batch is table-like data structure comprised of a sequence of arrays. The arrays can be of different types but they must all be the same length. Each array is referred to as one of the “fields” or “columns” of the record batch. This probably sounds terribly familiar to you as an R user, because – apart from a few differences in terminology – what I’ve just described to you is essentially the same kind of thing as a data frame. The parallels between record batches and data frames run deeper too:</p>
<ul>
<li>In R, the columns in a data frame must be named.<sup>6</sup> Record batches have the same property: each field must have a (UTF8-encoded) name, and these names form part of the metadata for the record batch.</li>
<li>A data frame in R is secretly just a list of vectors, and like any other list it does not really “contain” those vectors: rather it consists of a set of pointers that link to those vector objects. There’s a good discussion of list references in <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html#list-references">chapter 2 of Advanced R</a>. Record batches in Arrow are much the same. When stored in memory, the record batch does not include physical storage for the values stored in each field, it simply contains pointers to the relevant array objects. It does, however, contain its own validity bitmap.</li>
</ul>
<p>To illustrate, let’s return to our <code>dance_fever</code> data set. Here it is as a data frame (well, tibble technically, but whatever):</p>

<p>The <strong>arrow</strong> package provides two different ways to create a record batch. I can either use <code>RecordBatch$create()</code> or I can use the <code>record_batch()</code> function. The latter is simpler, so I’ll do that. The <code>record_batch()</code> function is pretty flexible, and can accept inputs in several formats. I can pass it a data frame, one or more named vectors, an input stream, or even a raw vector containing appropriate binary data. But I don’t need all that fancy complexity here so I’ll just give it a data frame:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb50" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb50-1">df <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">record_batch</span>(dance_fever)</span>
<span id="cb50-2">df</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

$track_number &lt;int32&gt;

<p>The output is amusingly terse. It doesn’t give a preview of the data, but it kindly confirms that this is a record batch containing 14 rows and 3 columns. It also tells me the column names and the type of data stored in each column. The <strong>arrow</strong> package supplies a <code>$</code> method for record batch objects, and it behaves the same way you’d expect for a data frame. If I want to look at a particular column in my record batch, I can refer to it by name like so:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb52" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb52-1">df<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span>title</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Array
&lt;string&gt;
[
  "King",
  "Free",
  "Choreomania",
  "Back in Town",
  "Girls Against God",
  "Dream Girl Evil",
  "Prayer Factory",
  "Cassandra",
  "Heaven Is Here",
  "Daffodil",
  "My Love",
  "Restraint",
  "The Bomb",
  "Morning Elvis"
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>At an abstract level the <code>df</code> object behaves like a two dimensional structure with rows and columns, but in terms of how it is represented in memory it is fundamentally a list of arrays, and so schematically I’ve drawn it like this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-05-25_arrays-and-tables-in-arrow/img/record_batch_layout.svg" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In some respects it’s structurally similar to a chunked array, insofar record batches and chunked arrays are both lists of arrays, but in other ways they are quite different. The arrays indexed in a record batch can be different types, but they must be the same length: this is required to ensure that at a high level we can treat a record batch like a two dimensional table. In contrast, the arrays indexed by a chunked array can be different lengths, but must all be the same type: this is required to ensure that at a high level we can treat a chunked array like a one dimensional vector.</p>
<p>Returning to the practical details, it’s worth noting that in addition to the <code>$</code> operator that refers to columns by name, you can use double brackets <code>[[</code> to refer to columns by position. Just like we saw with chunked array, these positions follow the R convention of using 1 to refer to the first element. The <code>df$title</code> array is the 2nd column in our record batch so I can extract it with this:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb54" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb54-1">df[[<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">2</span>]]</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Array
&lt;string&gt;
[
  "King",
  "Free",
  "Choreomania",
  "Back in Town",
  "Girls Against God",

  "Prayer Factory",
  "Cassandra",
  "Heaven Is Here",
  "Daffodil",
  "My Love",
  "Restraint",
  "The Bomb",
  "Morning Elvis"
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally there is a <code>[</code> method that allows you to extract subsets of a record batch in the same way you would for a data frame. The command <code>df[1:10, 1:2]</code> extracts the first 10 rows and the first 2 columns:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb56" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb56-1">df[<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">10</span>, <span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">2</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>RecordBatch
10 rows x 2 columns
$track_number &lt;int32&gt;
$title &lt;string&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you are wondering what <code>df[1:2]</code> returns, try it out for yourself. Hopefully you will not be surprised!</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="serialisation">Serialisation</h3>
<p>Before I move on to talk about Arrow tables, I want to make a small digression. At the beginning of this post I mentioned that my very first attempt to write about Arrow ended up becoming a post about <a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2021-11-15_serialisation-with-rds/">data serialisation in R</a> that had nothing to do with Arrow. That didn’t happen entirely by accident, and I’ll try to explain some of that now.</p>
<p>When we talk about data serialisation, what we’re talking about is taking a data structure stored in memory and organising it into a format that is suitable for writing to disk (serialising to file format) or transmitting over some other communication channel (serialising to a stream). From the beginning, data structures in Arrow were designed <em>together</em> with file formats and streaming formats, with the intention that – to the extent that it is practical and doesn’t mess with other important design considerations – the thing you send across the communication channel (or write to disk) has the same structure as the thing you need to store in memory. That way, when the data arrive at the other end, you don’t have to do a lot of work reorganising the data.</p>
<p>That… makes sense, right?</p>
<p>If I want to tell you to meet me under the bridge, the message I should send you should be “meet me under the bridge”. It makes no sense whatsoever for me to say “meet me [the title of that really annoying Red Hot Chilli Peppers song]” and expect you to decode it. There is no point in me expending effort deliberately obscuring what I’m trying to say, and then forcing you to expend effort trying to interpret my message.</p>
<p>Yet, surprisingly, that’s what happens a lot of the time when we send data across communication channels. For example, suppose you and I are both R users. We both work with data frames. Because a data frame is fundamentally a list of variables (each of which is a vector), we use data that are organised <em>column-wise</em>: the first thing in a data frame is column 1, then column 2, then column 3, and so on. Okay, cool. So now let’s say you want to send me a data set, and what you do is send me a CSV file. A CSV file is written row by row: the first thing in a CSV file is row 1, then row 2, then row 3. It is a <em>row-wise</em> data structure. In order for you to send data to me, what has to happen is you take your column-wise data frame, invert it so that it is now a row-wise structure, write that to a CSV and then send it to me. At the other end, I have to invert the whole process, transforming the row-wise structure into a column-wise organisation that I can now load into memory as a data frame.<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Um… that <em>doesn’t</em> make sense.</p>
<p>This particular problem arises quite a lot, largely because serialisation formats and in-memory data structures aren’t always designed in tandem. To get around this, Arrow specifies the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#serialization-and-interprocess-communication-ipc">Interprocess Communication</a> (IPC) serialisation format that is designed specifically to ensure that Arrow data objects can be transmitted (and saved) efficiently. Because data sets are typically organised into tabular structures, the primitive unit for communication is the record batch. I’m not going to dive into the very low level details of how IPC messages are structured, but the key thing for our purposes is that IPC is designed to ensure that the structure of the serialised record batch is essentially identical to the physical layout of an in-memory record batch.</p>
<p>I’ll give a very simple example. Let’s take the first few rows of the <code>dance_fever</code> data set and convert them into a small record batch:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb58" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb58-1">df_batch_0 <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">record_batch</span>(dance_fever[<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">4</span>,])</span>
<span id="cb58-2">df_batch_0</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>RecordBatch
4 rows x 3 columns
$track_number &lt;int32&gt;
$title &lt;string&gt;
$duration &lt;int32&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Suppose I want to share this. Currently this is an object in memory that consists of three arrays (which are contiguous in memory) but as we’ve seen earlier, these arrays are themselves comprised of multiple buffers. What the IPC format does is collect the relevant metadata into a “data header”,<sup>8</sup> and then lay out the buffers one after the other. Glossing a few minor details<sup>9</sup>, this is essentially what the IPC message would look like for this record batch:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">

</div>
</div>
<p>At this point you’re probably thinking okay that’s nice Danielle, but how do I do this? There are three functions you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>To send the data directly to an output stream use <code>write_ipc_stream()</code>.</li>
<li>To write data in IPC format to a static file on disk it is referred to as a “feather” formatted file,<sup>10</sup> and you use <code>write_feather()</code>.</li>
<li>To construct the same sequence of bytes but return them in R as raw vectors, you can use <code>write_to_raw()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to show you what the byte stream actually looks like, I’ll use the <code>write_to_raw()</code> function:</p>

<p>To reassure you that this byte stream does indeed contain the relevant information, I’ll use the <code>read_ipc_stream()</code> function to decode it. By default this function returns data to R natively as a tibble, which is fine for my purposes:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb62" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb62-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">read_ipc_stream</span>(df_ipc_0)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code># A tibble: 4 × 3
  track_number title        duration
         &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt;
1            1 King              280
2            2 Free              234
3            3 Choreomania       213
4            4 Back in Town      236</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>We can use the same logic to write data to disk. As mentioned above, when writing data in IPC format to file, the result is called a “feather” file. So okay, let’s take the rest of the <code>dance_fever</code> data, and write it to a feather file:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb64" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb64-1">dance_fever[<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">5</span><span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">:</span><span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">14</span>,] <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb64-2">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">record_batch</span>() <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">|&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb64-3">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">write_feather</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"df_ipc_1.feather"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we can read this feather file from disk:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb65" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb65-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">read_feather</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"df_ipc_1.feather"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Yay! It’s always nice when things do what you expect them to do.</p>
<p>Before moving on, there’s one last thing I should mention. The feather file format is a handy thing to know about, and can be very convenient in some instances, but it’s not really optimised to be the best “big data file format”. It’s intended to be the file format analog of IPC messages, and those in turn are designed for optimal streaming of Arrow data. Because of this, in practice you will probably not find yourself using the feather format all that much. Instead, you’re more likely to use something like <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Apache Parquet</a>, which is explicitly designed for this purpose. Arrow and parquet play nicely with one another, and <strong>arrow</strong> supports reading and parquet files using the <code>read_parquet()</code> and <code>write_parquet()</code> functions. However, parquet is a topic for a future post, so that’s all I’ll say about this today!</p>

<p>Earlier when I introduced the concept of chunked arrays, I explained that Arrow needs these structures because arrays are immutable objects, and Arrow is designed to avoid copying data whenever possible: when a new block of data arrive, it is stored as its own array without disturbing the existing ones, and we use the chunked array as a wrapper that lets us pretend that all these chunks are laid out end to end in a single vector. The previous section shows you exactly how that can happen. If I have a data set that arrives sequentially as a sequence of record batches, I have this problem for every column in the data set! Quite by accident<sup>11</sup> that’s what happened in the last section – the <code>dance_fever</code> data set has been serialised in two parts. In that example it happened because I wanted to show you what an IPC stream looked like (creating one record batch for that) as well as what a feather file looks like (creating another record batch), but in real life it’s more likely to happen every time you receive an update on an ongoing data collection process (e.g., today’s data arrive).</p>
<p>To deal with this situation, we need a tabular data structure that is similar to a record batch with one exception: instead of storing each column as an array, we now want to store it as a chunked array. This is what the <code>Table</code> class in <strong>arrow</strong> does. Schematically, here’s what the data structure for a table looks like:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-05-25_arrays-and-tables-in-arrow/img/table_layout.svg" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Tables have a huge advantage over record batches: they can be concatenated. You can’t append one record batch to another because arrays are immutable: you can’t append one array to the end of another array. You would have to create a new array with all new data – and do this for <em>every</em> column in the data – which is a thing we really don’t want to do. But because tables are built from chunked arrays, concatenation is easy: all you have to do is update the chunked arrays so that they include pointers to the newly-arrived arrays as well as the previously-existing arrays.</p>
<p>Because tables are so much more flexible than record batches, functions in <strong>arrow</strong> tend to return tables rather than record batches. Unless you do what I did in the previous section and deliberately call <code>record_batch()</code> you’re not likely to encounter them as the output of normal data analysis code.<sup>12</sup> For instance, in the previous section I serialised two record batches, one to a file and one to a raw vector. Let’s look at what happens when I try to deserialise (a.k.a. “read”) them. First the IPC stream:</p>

<p>That’s the same data as before, but it’s a table not a record batch. Each column is a chunked array, not an array. The same happens when I read from the feather file:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb69" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb69-1">df_table_1 <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">read_feather</span>(</span>

<span id="cb69-3">  <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">as_data_frame =</span> <span class="cn" style="color: #8f5902;">FALSE</span></span>
<span id="cb69-4">)</span>
<span id="cb69-5">df_table_1</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Table
10 rows x 3 columns
$track_number &lt;int32&gt;
$title &lt;string&gt;
$duration &lt;int32&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Again, this is a table. In general, you won’t get a record batch in <strong>arrow</strong> unless you explicitly ask for one. Tables are the default tabular data structure, which is usually what you want anyway.</p>
<p>Okay, so now I have the two fragments of my data set represented as tables. The difference between the table version and the record batch version is that the columns are all represented as chunked arrays. Each array from the original record batch is now one chunk in the corresponding chunked array in the table:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb71" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb71-1">df_batch_0<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span>title</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Array
&lt;string&gt;
[
  "King",
  "Free",
  "Choreomania",
  "Back in Town"
]</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb73" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb73-1">df_table_0<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span>title</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>ChunkedArray
[
  [
    "King",
    "Free",
    "Choreomania",
    "Back in Town"
  ]
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>It’s the same underlying data (and indeed the same immutable array is referenced by both), just enclosed by a new, flexible chunked array wrapper. However, it is this wrapper that allows us to concatenate tables:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb75" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb75-1">df <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">concat_tables</span>(</span>
<span id="cb75-2">  df_table_0,</span>
<span id="cb75-3">  df_table_1</span>
<span id="cb75-4">)</span>
<span id="cb75-5">df</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>Table
14 rows x 3 columns
$track_number &lt;int32&gt;
$title &lt;string&gt;
$duration &lt;int32&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is successful (yay!) and the result will behave exactly like a two dimensional object with <code>$</code>, <code>[[</code>, and <code>[</code> operators that behave as you expect them to<sup>13</sup> (yay!), but if you look closely you can still see the “seams” showing where the tables were appended:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb77" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb77-1">df<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">$</span>title</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>ChunkedArray
[
  [
    "King",
    "Free",
    "Choreomania",
    "Back in Town"
  ],
  [
    "Girls Against God",
    "Dream Girl Evil",
    "Prayer Factory",
    "Cassandra",
    "Heaven Is Here",
    "Daffodil",
    "My Love",
    "Restraint",
    "The Bomb",
    "Morning Elvis"
  ]
]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>When tables are concatenated the chunking is preserved. That’s because those are the original arrays, still located at the same spot in memory. That’s efficient from a memory use perspective, but again, don’t forget that the chunking is not semantically meaningful, and there is no guaranteed that a write-to-file operation (e.g., to parquet format) will preserve those chunks.</p>

<p>So what about datasets? They’re the last item on that table, and you might be wondering where they fall in all this. I’m not going to dive into the details on datasets in this post, because they’re a whole separate topic and they deserve their own blog post. However, it’s a little unsatisfying to write all this and not say anything about them, so I’ll give a very quick overview here.</p>
<p>Up to this point I’ve talked about tabular data sets that are contained entirely in memory. When such data are written to disk, they are typically written to a single file. For larger-than-memory data sets, a different strategy is needed. Only a subset of the data can be stored in memory at any point in time, and as a consequence it becomes convenient to write the data to disk by partitioning it into many smaller files. This functionality is supported in Arrow via Datasets.</p>
<p>I’ll give a simple example here, using a small data set. Let’s suppose I’ve downloaded the entire Florence + The Machine discography using the <strong>spotifyr</strong> package:</p>

<p>The <code>florence</code> data frame is of course quite small, and I have no real need to use Arrow Datasets: it’s small enough that I can store it natively in R as a tibble! But it will suffice to illustrate concepts that come in handy when working with large datasets.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose I want to partition this in into many data files, using the album release year as the basis for the partitioning. To do this I’ll use the <code>write_dataset()</code> function, specifying <code>partitioning = "album_release_year"</code> to ensure that files are created after splitting the data set by release year. By default, the <code>write_dataset()</code> function writes individual data files in the parquet format, which is in general a very good default choice for large tabular data sets. However, because I have not talked about <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Apache Parquet</a> in this post, I’ll make a different choice and write the data files in the feather format that we’ve seen earlier in this post. I can do that by setting <code>format = "feather"</code>. Finally, I’ll set <code>path = "spotify_florence"</code> to ensure that all the files are stored in a folder by that name. That gives this command:</p>

<p>These file names are written in “Hive partitioning” format. It looks a little weird the first time you encounter it, because <code>=</code> is a character most coders instinctively avoid including in file names because it has such a strong meaning in programming contexts. However, when files are named in Hive partitioning format, the intended interpretation is exactly the one you implicitly expect as a coder: it’s a <code>field_name=value</code> statement, so you will often encounter files with names like</p>
<pre><code>/year=2019/month=2/data.parquet</code></pre>
<p>For more information see the help documentation for the <code>hive_partitioning()</code> function in the <strong>arrow</strong> package.</p>
<p>In any case, the key thing is that I’ve now written the data to disk in a fashion that splits it across multiple files. For the Florence + The Machine discography data this is is really not needed because the entire <code>spotify_florence</code> folder occupies a mere 320kB on my hard drive. However, elsewhere on my laptop I have a copy of the infamous New York City Taxi data set, and that one occupies a rather more awkward 69GB of storage. For that one, it really does matter that I have it written to disk in a sensible format!</p>
<p>Having a data set stored in a distributed multi-file format is nice, but it’s only useful if I can open it and work with it as if it were the same as a regular tabular data set. The <code>open_dataset()</code> function allows me to do exactly this. Here’s what happens when I open the file:</p>

<p>Okay yes, the output makes clear that I have loaded <em>something</em> and it has registered the existence of the 7 constituent files that comprise the dataset as a whole. But can I work with it? One of the big selling points to the <strong>arrow</strong> package is that it supplies a <strong>dplyr</strong> backend that lets me work with <code>Tables</code> as if they were R data frames, using familiar syntax. Can I do the same thing with <code>Datasets</code>?</p>

<li id="fn3"><p>Quick explanation: As a general rule, if you want things to be efficient you want the beginnings and endings of your data structures to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure_alignment">naturally aligned</a>, in the sense that the memory address is a multiple of the data block sizes. So on a 64-bit machine, you want the memory address for every data structure to start on a multiple of 64 bits. Apparently that makes lookup easier or something. Unfortunately, I’ve only specified 8 bits (i.e.&nbsp;1 byte) so if I wanted to ensure that the validity bitmap is naturally aligned I’m going to need to add another 7 bytes worth of padding in order to make it to the full 64 bits. This method of aligning data structures in memory is referred to as “8 byte alignment”. However, what Arrow does in this situation is <em>64 byte alignment</em>, so each data structure has to be 64 bytes long at a minimum. This design feature exists to allow efficient use of modern hardware, and if you want to know more, it’s discussed in the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#buffer-alignment-and-padding">Arrow documentation</a>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>More precisely, signed 32 bit integers.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>I know, I know. Nothing is impossible. But you know what I mean.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>If you don’t specify names when creating a data frame, R will create them for you. For example, when you create an ostensibly unnamed data frame with a command like <code>x &lt;- data.frame(1:2, 3:4)</code>, you’ll find that <code>x</code> still has a <code>names</code> attribute, and <code>names(x)</code> returns X1.2, X3.4↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>On the off chance that you’re one of those extremely sensible people who chose not to read my data serialisation post, I’ll mention that the native RDS format that R uses avoids this trap. Much like Arrow serialisation formats, RDS preserves the column wise organisation to data frames.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>The data header for contains the length and null count for each flattened field. It also contains the memory offset (i.e., the start point) and length of every buffer that is stored in the message body.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>For instance, there are padding requirements involved that I am ignoring here.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Full disclosure: there are a few minor differences between the IPC streaming format and the feather file format. I’ve glossed over those in this post but you can find the details on the <a href="https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Columnar.html#ipc-file-format">Arrow specification page</a>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>Okay fine, I’m lying. I did it on purpose.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>If you ever do need to convert a record batch to a table you can use <code>as_arrow_table()</code>.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>Because tables are built from chunked arrays, and chunked arrays are an abstraction layer designed to ensure that the distinct arrays can be treated as if they were one contiguous vector, Arrow tables inherit all those features. You can subset tables with <code>$</code>, <code>[[</code>, and <code>[</code> the same way you can for record batches.↩︎</p></li>

<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->
<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->
<p>A little over a year ago I decided to <a href="../../welcome">start blogging again</a>, and set up this site. At the time I made the deliberate choice to use <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/distill/">distill</a> as my blogging platform rather than something that would require a static site generator like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> or <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jeykll</a>, and I don’t regret that choice. However, along the way I’ve found a few things that have bothered me about using distill. It’s never been worth considering changing to something new though, because distill has so many things that I do like. Until now.</p>
<p>Enter, stage left, <a href="https://quarto.org/">quarto</a>.</p>
<p>Now out of stealth mode and attracting no end of attention, quarto offers the promise of being a cross-platform, cross-format, open source publishing tool based on pandoc. Intrigued, I decided to play around with it for a while, and ended up making the decision to port this blog from distill to quarto. This post outlines my process.</p>
<p>(I am a little nervous: porting a blog often involves recomputing things. Will it work? Will everything turn out to be reproducible? I hope so…)</p>
<section id="getting-started" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>The very first thing I do is go read Alison Hill’s wonderful <a href="https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2022-04-we-dont-talk-about-quarto/">We don’t talk about quarto</a> blog post. If you’re an R markdown user considering making the jump to quarto and haven’t already read her summary of where things are at, you won’t regret it. It’s a nice high level overview. I’d also suggest <a href="https://www.njtierney.com/post/2022/04/11/rmd-to-qmd/">Nick Tierney’s notes</a> on making the switch, which is very helpful also.</p>
<p>After doing my background reading, I go to the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/">get started page</a> on the quarto website to download the installer file. I’m on Ubuntu, so for me that’s a <code>.deb</code> file. I install it in the usual way from the command line:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">sudo</span> dpkg <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">-i</span> quarto-0.9.282-linux-amd64.deb</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now that I have quarto installed, I’m able to use it to create a blog. My old distill blog exists in a project folder that I’d imaginatively named <code>distill-blog</code>, so I decide to keep to tradition and create the quarto version in an equally boring project folder called <code>quarto-blog</code>.</p>
<p>There is a page on the quarto website that walks you through the process for <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html">creating a blog</a>, which I dutifully follow. From the terminal, I use the <code>quarto create-project</code> command, and a variety of files are created:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">quarto</span> create-project quarto-blog <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">--type</span> website:blog</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>Creating project at /home/danielle/GitHub/sites/quarto-blog:
  - Created _quarto.yml
  - Created index.qmd
  - Created posts/welcome/index.qmd
  - Created posts/post-with-code/index.qmd
  - Created about.qmd
  - Created styles.css
  - Created posts/_metadata.yml</code></pre>
<p>Coming from an R markdown background, this is very familiar:</p>
<ul>
<li>The files with a <code>.qmd</code> extension are the quarto markdown documents. These contain source code for the blog posts (the two files in the <code>posts</code> folder), the home page (the <code>index.qmd</code> file in the project root folder) and a standalone “about me” page for the blog (the <code>about.qmd</code> file).</li>
<li>The files with a <code>.yml</code> extension are the YAML files used to configure the blog. I don’t notice this at first, but the fact that there are two of them is important. The <code>_quarto.yml</code> file is used for settings that will apply across the entire site, but you will often want to configure settings that only apply to your blog posts. Those can be set by editing the <code>posts/_metadata.yml</code> file.</li>
<li>The <code>styles.css</code> file can be used to specify custom CSS rules that will apply to the whole site. I’ll talk more about styles later.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="rendering-posts" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="rendering-posts">Rendering posts</h2>
<p>There are several different ways to interact with quarto. For example, later in the post I’ll talk about the quarto command line interface which allows you to work with quarto without going through R or RStudio. However, when getting started I try to keep things simple, and go with the option that was most familiar to me: I use RStudio.</p>
<p>To do this, it’s convenient to have an RStudio project for my blog. Using the RStudio file menu, I create a new project from an existing directory (i.e., my <code>quarto-blog</code> folder), which supplies the <code>quarto-blog.Rproj</code> file and other infrastructure needed to work with my new quarto blog as an RStudio project. Once that’s done, I am able to open up a quarto file in the RStudio editor and see a familiar looking interface:</p>
<div class="cell page-columns page-full" data-layout-align="center">
<div class="cell-output-display page-columns page-full">
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center page-columns page-full">
<figure class="figure page-columns page-full">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/img/welcome_post.png" class="img-fluid figure-img" width="805"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption margin-caption">A blog post written in quarto markdown open in the RStudio editor. Notice that in the place where one would normally expect to see the ‘Knit’ button for an R markdown document, there is a ‘Render’ button. It serves the same function and is mapped to the same hot keys as the ‘Knit’ button</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>From here I can click on the “Render” button to render a single page, or alternatively I can go to the RStudio build pane and select the “Render Project” option to build the entire site. By default, the blog builds into the <code>_site</code> folder.</p>
</section>
<section id="playing-around" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="playing-around">Playing around</h2>
<p>Progress! I am making progress. However, before trying to do any other practical things, I have some very important business to attend to: playing around. Aimlessly exploring the functionality of a new tool is always fun, and I find it’s a good way to familiarise myself with something. I’m pretty familiar with R markdown already, and I imagine most readers of this post will be too, so for the most part there are no surprises. Still it is worth asking myself the usual questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I add footnotes?<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Can they be nested?<sup>2</sup></li>
<li>Can I add comments in the margin?</li>
</ul>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>A comment in the margin</p>
</div></div><p>Looking at the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html">quarto article layout documentation</a>, I discover some nice features. You can use the <code>:::{.class}</code> notation to apply a CSS class to a section of output, like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb4-1">:::{.column-margin}</span>
<span id="cb4-2">A comment in the margin</span>
<span id="cb4-3">:::</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>.column-margin</code> class is handy for margin asides, but there are several other useful classes that come in handy when adding images to blog posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.column-body</code> spans the usual body width of the post</li>
<li><code>.column-body-outset</code> extends slightly outside the usual width</li>
<li><code>.column-page</code> spans the whole page (including both margins)</li>
<li><code>.column-screen</code> class spans the full width of the screen</li>
<li><code>.column-screen-inset</code> class stops just short of the full screen width</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set these inside a chunk option. For example, setting <code>column: margin</code> as a chunk option will assign the output a <code>.column-margin</code> class, and any resulting figure will appear in the margin rather than below the code. Similarly, setting <code>column: screen</code> as the chunk option will assign the output a <code>.column-screen</code> class, and the output will span the full width. Here’s a simple example based pretty closely on the one used in the quarto documentation:</p>
<div class="cell page-columns page-full">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">library</span>(leaflet)</span>

<section id="notes-on-yaml-headers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="notes-on-yaml-headers">Notes on YAML headers</h2>
<p>The YAML headers used for blog posts are a little different in quarto than their equivalents in distill were, and it takes me a moment to work out how to adapt the YAML headers from my old R markdown posts for the new quarto blog. Here’s a quick overview. First, some fields require almost no changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>title</code> field is unchanged. That was an easy one!</li>
<li>The <code>date</code> field is essentially unchanged, except for the fact there seems to be a tiny bug in date parsing for blogs that I’m sure will vanish soon. If you’re using ISO-8601 date formats like <code>date: "2022-04-20"</code> it will be fine.<sup>3</sup></li>
<li>The <code>categories</code> field takes a list of values, which (I think?) is no different to what it looked like before. To be honest I don’t remember because my old blog didn’t use them. I’ve started now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes are superficial:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>description</code> field that I used on my old blog still does what it used to: it provides preview text on the listing page, and a summary at the top of the file. However, there is also a <code>subtitle</code> field that you can use for this purpose, and the output has the same look and field as my old descriptions, so I decide to switch all my old description fields to <code>subtitle</code> entries.</li>
<li>To specify a preview image associated with a blog post, use the <code>image</code> field (e.g., something like <code>image: thumbnail.jpg</code>) instead of the <code>preview</code> field from distill.</li>
<li>There is a new <code>license</code> field that replaces the <code>creative_commons</code> field from distill. At the bottom of this post you’ll see a “Reuse” appendix that links to a license file. To generate this, I’ve included a <code>license: "CC BY"</code> line in the YAML.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes are a little deeper:</p>
<ul>
<li>In distill it is possible to specify the <code>author</code> field in a lot of detail, mirroring the academic convention of listing an authors affiliation alongside their employer, orcid record, and contact details. Quarto supports this also, though the tags have changed slightly: <code>orcid_id</code> is now <code>orcid</code>, for example. There’s an example of this shown a little later in the post.</li>
<li>Specifying the table of contents is slightly different. Just like in distill, you can turn on the table of contents by including <code>toc: true</code> as a line in the YAML header, and set the <code>toc-depth</code> field to determine how detailed the table of contents should be. But there are new options. You can customise the text that appears above the table of contents, and the location in which it appears. I decide to be boring and go with some standard options: <code>toc-title: Table of contents</code> and <code>toc-location: left</code>.</li>
<li>One feature in distill that I like is that it generates a citation for each post. You can do that in quarto too, and you’ll see at the bottom of this post that I’ve used that feature here. However, quarto manages this in a different way to distill, and uses a YAML version of <a href="https://citationstyles.org/">citation style language</a> (CSL) formatting to define the citation. To see how it works, you can read through the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/reference/metadata/citation.html">quarto pages on citations</a> and <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/create-citeable-articles.html">creating citeable articles</a>. It’s a little more elaborate than the distill version, but much more flexible. For this blog it’s as simple as including <code>citation: true</code> in the YAML, but it can be more elaborate and accommodate any pattern of academic citation you like.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="creating-a-new-post" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-a-new-post">Creating a new post</h2>
<p>Okay. Time to get to work at transforming the starter blog into a quarto version of my distill blog. My first step is to delete the two posts that came with the starter blog, and then create this one.</p>
<p>A folder with an <code>index.qmd</code> file is the bare minimum I need to get started with a new post. I suppose there are other ways do to this but what I actually do is create the the folder and an empty file from the terminal (for reasons known but to god):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb6-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">mkdir</span> posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">touch</span> posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/index.qmd</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To be honest, using the terminal was overkill. What I could have done instead, had I been looking at RStudio rather than the terminal, is use the “New File” option in the file menu and then select the “Quarto Doc” option. That creates a new untitled quarto document that you can save to the appropriate location.</p>
</section>
<section id="inheriting-yaml-settings" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inheriting-yaml-settings">Inheriting YAML settings</h2>
<p>A handy feature in quarto websites is that YAML fields are inherited. For example, this post has its own YAML header that contains the following – and only the following – fields:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">title</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> </span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"Porting a distill blog to quarto"</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">subtitle</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">: </span><span class="ch" style="color: #20794D;">|</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> </span></span>
<span id="cb7-3">  I have moved this blog from distill over to quarto, and </span>
<span id="cb7-4">  taken notes. A year after starting the blog, this promises </span>
<span id="cb7-5">  to be an interesting reproducibility test</span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">date</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> </span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"2022-04-20"</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">categories</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> </span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">[</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">Quarto</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">,</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> Blogging</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">,</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> Reproducibility</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">]</span></span>
<span id="cb7-8"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">image</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> </span><span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"img/preview.jpg"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s a little peculiar, because a lot of the metadata needed to specify this post is missing. The reason it is missing is that I’ve placed some fields in the <code>posts/_metadata.yml</code> file. Those fields are inherited by every blog post. This is the entire contents of my post metadata file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb8" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb8-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;"># Freeze computed outputs</span></span>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>The <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/projects/code-execution.html">freeze option</a> is extremely useful in the blogging context. I’d advise reading the linked documentation page!</p>
</div></div><p>That explains a lot, but if you’re looking closely you’ll realise that there’s nothing in these fields specifying the output format! In R markdown I’d have included an <code>output</code> field for this, but in quarto the relevant field is called <code>format</code>. Because the output applies to the entire site, that part of the YAML header is in the <code>_quarto.yml</code> file. The relevant lines of that file are:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb9-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">format</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">  </span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">html</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">    </span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">theme</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> ember.scss</span></span>

<p>I’ll come back to this later. For now it’s enough to recognise that this indicates that all pages on this site should be rendered to HTML documents, and using the <code>ember.scss</code> and <code>styles.css</code> files specify the blog style.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="converting-my-old-posts">Converting my old posts</h2>
<p>The time has come for a little manual labour. Although quarto is compatible with most existing R markdown and I can probably get away with leaving them untouched, in the longer term I’m expecting that I’ll be moving across languages so it appeals to me to take this opportunity to port everything over to quarto now. Renaming all the <code>index.Rmd</code> files to <code>index.qmd</code> files is easy enough, and can be done programmatically, but most of my edits require a small amount of manual tinkering with each post. Not a lot, because it is mostly a matter of renaming a few YAML fields. Given that there are only 20 or so posts that need to be ported, I decide it is easier to do it manually than to try to write a script to automate the task. I get through it in an afternoon.</p>

<section id="styling-the-new-blog" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="styling-the-new-blog">Styling the new blog</h2>
<p>Up to this point, the adoption of quarto has felt very “distill-like”. The structure of the blog feels familiar from distill, the YAML headers are similar in spirit (if different in the particulars), and so on. When it comes to customising the appearance of the blog, it’s not very similar to distill at all, and feels more similar to simple R markdown sites. Quarto websites are bootstrap based, and as discussed on the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html">quarto theming page</a>, they come with the same bootswatch themes that you might be familiar with from R markdown. For example, if you decide like I did that you would like a very plain white theme, you could choose the “litera” theme. To apply this to your blog, all you’d have to do is make sure your <code>_quarto.yml</code> file contains the following lines:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb10-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">format</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">  </span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">html</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">    </span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">theme</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> litera</span></span>
<span id="cb10-4"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">    </span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">css</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> styles.css</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What this does is assert that output will be rendered as HTML objects using the litera bootswatch theme, and applying any custom CSS rules that you add in the <code>styles.css</code> file.</p>
<p>One very nice feature of quarto, if you’re comfortable using SASS to define styles and know something about how the bootstrap SASS files are organised,<sup>4</sup> is that it allows you to write your own <code>.scss</code> file to define your blog theme more precisely, giving you access to bootstrap parameters and so on. I would strongly recommend reading about the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes-more.html">quarto theming system</a> before tinkering with this aspect yourself, but if you are more knowledgeable (or more foolish) than I, here’s how I set my blog up. First, instead of referring to the litera theme, the YAML in my <code>_quarto.yml</code> file points at my own custom <code>.scss</code> file:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode yaml code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode yaml"><span id="cb11-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">format</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">  </span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">html</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">    </span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">theme</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> ember.scss</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4"><span class="at" style="color: #657422;">    </span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">css</span><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;">:</span><span class="at" style="color: #657422;"> styles.css</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The contents of the <code>ember.scss</code> file are as follows:</p>

<span id="cb12-18">}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As you can see, right now my customisation really doesn’t do much other than make some very minor tweaks on the litera theme, but the potential is there to do so much more than I have in setting up this blog. I plan to tinker with this more later on!</p>

<section id="adding-an-rss-feed" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-an-rss-feed">Adding an RSS feed</h2>
<p>My old distill blog had an RSS feed, and while I acknowledge that it’s increasingly an esoteric feature that most folks don’t use, I have a fondness for RSS. Quarto supports this, but it’s not enabled by default. What I need to do is edit the YAML in the <code>index.qmd</code> file that corresponds to your homepage, because that’s where I have my primary listing of posts. In it, I see a <code>listing</code> field. All I need to do is add <code>feed: true</code> underneath and there is now an RSS feed for the site:</p>

<section id="deploying-the-site" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="deploying-the-site">Deploying the site</h2>
<p>Preparing the site to be deployed is relatively painless. I found it useful to read the <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/websites.html">quarto website options page</a> before doing this, because it mentions a lot of settings to tinker with, mostly in the <code>_quarto.yml</code> file. For example, I choose to customise the navigation bar, the social media preview images, and so on. Eventually, I reach the point where I am happy and move on to deployment.</p>
<p>Happily, as to the deployment process itself, there’s not a lot to say. The <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/websites/publishing-websites.html">quarto deployment page</a> discusses several options for how you can do this. Most of my websites are deployed either through GitHub Pages or through Netlify. This one is a Netlify site, so I follow the instructions there and everything goes smoothly. However, this does bring me to another topic…</p>
</section>
<section id="netlify-redirects" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="netlify-redirects">Netlify redirects</h2>
<p>I’ve structured my blog in a particular way. Like the default quarto blog, all the posts live in the <code>posts</code> folder, and they’re named in a systematic way: they have an ISO-8601 formatted date first, and then a semantic slug. So the full URL for this blog post is:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/">blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto</a></p>
<p>That’s convenient for archiving purposes and for keeping everything nicely organised in my project folder, but it’s also a little clunky for sharing links. In practice, the “posts” part is a bit redundant, and I’m never going to use the same slug twice, so it’s handy to set it up so that there’s also a shorter URL for the post,</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.djnavarro.net/porting-to-quarto/">blog.djnavarro.net/porting-to-quarto</a></p>
<p>and that this shorter URL automatically redirects to the longer one.</p>
<p>Since I’m intending to deploy this blog to Netlify, what I need to do is ensure that whenever the site builds, a <code>_redirects</code> file is created within the <code>_site</code> folder. This file needs to have one line per redirect, listing the “redirect from” path first, followed by the “redirect to” path. Here’s what that line looks like for this post:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode default code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode default"><span id="cb14-1">/porting-to-quarto /posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I have no intention of adding these lines manually, so what I do instead is add an R chunk to the <code>index.qmd</code> file corresponding to the blog home page, with the following code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb15-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;"># list names of post folders</span></span>

<p>Every time this site gets rebuilt – which usually involves rebuilding the home page since that’s the one that contains the post listing – the <code>_redirects</code> file gets refreshed. There might be a cleaner way, but this works.</p>

I haven’t made any particular decisions about what my long term workflow with quarto is going to look like, but I did find it helpful to get a feel for the concept of quarto as a standalone install. I’m not going to go into detail here, but just briefly: at the terminal I can see that I have some help options,</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb16" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb16-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">quarto</span> help</span></code></pre></div>

    </code></pre>
<p>From there I can check the help documentation for the <code>quarto render</code> command by typing the following,</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb18" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb18-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">quarto</span> render help</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>and so on. Browsing this documentation in addition to all the excellent content on the quarto website is a useful way of finding additional options. If I wanted to render the current post, and my terminal was currently at the project root folder (i.e., my <code>quarto-blog</code> folder), I can render it as follows:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb19" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb19-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;">quarto</span> render posts/2022-04-20_porting-to-quarto/index.qmd</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The ability to do this cleanly from the terminal seems like a handy feature of quarto, though I’ll admit I am not yet sure how I’ll use it.</p>
</section>
<section id="epilogue" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>When I started this process I wasn’t quite sure if I was going to follow through on it and actually switch the blog over to quarto. The distill blog has served me well for the last year, and I don’t like fixing things if they aren’t broken. However, the longer I played with quarto the more I liked it, and the process was far less painful than I feared it would be. I feel like it’s retained the things I like about distill, but integrated those cleanly with other features (e.g., the bootstrap grid!) that I really missed having access to from distill. Every now and then I’ve come across little quirks where some of the rough edges to quarto are still showing – it is a new tool still – but I’m enjoying it a lot.</p>

  <title>Using Amazon S3 with R</title>

<!--------------- setup post ----------------->
<!--------------- post ----------------->
<p>I have a shameful confession to make, one that may shock and surprise you. Although I am an R user, data scientist, and developer of many years experience, I’ve never used Amazon Web Services.</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe, I know, but I’ve never spun up a virtual machine on “Amazon EC2” (…whatever <em>that</em> is), I don’t know what “AWS Lambda” is, and the only thing I know about “Amazon S3” is that fancy data science people use it to store data. Or something along those lines. Honestly, I really haven’t been paying attention. Every time people start talking about it my eyes glaze over and my impostor syndrome arrives to berate me. A <em>true</em> data scientist is born knowing how to spin up EC2 instances, and if baby doesn’t post her drawings on S3 then she’s already falling behind, etc etc. It’s terribly stressful.</p>
<p>My dark and terrible personal tragedy notwithstanding,<sup>1</sup> I suspect my situation is not entirely uncommon. Back in my academic days, I knew very few people who used Amazon Web Services (a.k.a. AWS) for much of anything. It wasn’t needed, so it wasn’t knowledge that people acquired. Now that I’m working in an industry setting I’m finding that it’s <em>so</em> widely used that it’s almost assumed knowledge. <em>Everyone</em> knows this stuff, so there’s not a lot said about why you might care, or how to get started using these tools if you decide that you do care.</p>
<p>Today I decided to do something about this, starting by teaching myself how to use Amazon’s Simple Storage Service (a.k.a S3). With the help of the <a href="https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.s3"><strong>aws.s3</strong></a> package authored by Thomas Leeper and currently maintained by Simon Urbanek, it’s surprisingly easy to do.</p>
<p>In this post I’ll walk you through the process.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-s3-and-why-do-i-care">What is S3 and why do I care?</h2>
<p>Let’s get started. As with everything else in life, the place to start is asking yourself if you even care. I mean, if we don’t care what S3 is or what it does, why even bother? Just let your eyes glaze over as the nerd keeps talking and wonder if there’s anything good on TV…</p>
<p>Still here? Cool.</p>
<p>From the user perspective, Amazon’s “Simple Storage Service” isn’t particularly complicated. It’s just a remote storage system that you can dump files into, kind of like a programmable Dropbox. Each file (and its accompanying metadata) is stored as an <em>object</em>, and collections of objects are grouped together into a <em>bucket</em>. If you want to store files on S3, all you need to do is open an account, create a new bucket, and upload your files. It’s exactly that boring, and the only reason anyone cares (as far as I know) is that Amazon designed this to work at scale and it’s fairly easy to write scripts that allow you to control the whole thing programmatically. Which is actually a pretty handy service, now that I think about it!</p>
<p><br></p>
</section>
<section id="downloading-public-data-from-s3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="downloading-public-data-from-s3">Downloading public data from S3</h2>
<p>The first thing to understand about S3 is that there’s many different ways of using it. Very often, you’re not interested in storing your own data on S3. You might just want to download data that someone else has stored, and if that data has been made publicly accessible, then you don’t even need an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account at all. You can download to your hearts content. For a data scientist it’s a fun way to start, because you get to dive straight into playing with data insted of fiddling about with accounts and credentials and all those dull things.</p>
<p>So let’s find a public data set to play with. While browsing through the registry of open data sets listed on the S3 website I came across the <a href="https://registry.opendata.aws/nsw-herbarium/">National Herbarium of NSW data set</a>. As described on the website:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The National Herbarium of New South Wales is one of the most significant scientific, cultural and historical botanical resources in the Southern hemisphere. The 1.43 million preserved plant specimens have been captured as high-resolution images and the biodiversity metadata associated with each of the images captured in digital form. Botanical specimens date from year 1770 to today, and form voucher collections that document the distribution and diversity of the world’s flora through time, particularly that of NSW, Austalia and the Pacific. The data is used in biodiversity assessment, systematic botanical research, ecosystem conservation and policy development. The data is used by scientists, students and the public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example, here’s one of the images stored in the data set, of a plant specimen collected quite close to where I currently live, albeit quite a long time ago:</p>
<p><br></p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output-display">
<p><img src="https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2022-03-17_using-aws-s3-in-r/https:/tiny-herbs.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/NSW29246.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>So yeah, I love this data set already and I want to play with it. But how do I do that? I’ve never done anything with S3 before and it’s all a bit new to me. Well, on the right hand side of the listing page for the National Herbarium data, there’s a section that contains the following metadata:</p>
<pre><code>Description
Herbarium Collection Image files

Resource type
S3 Bucket

Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
arn:aws:s3:::herbariumnsw-pds

AWS Region
ap-southeast-2</code></pre>
<p>Using this information, I can get started. I know <em>what</em> the data is (an S3 bucket), I know <em>where</em> the data is (in the <code>"ap-southeast-2"</code> region), and on top of that I know the <em>name</em> of the data (<code>"herbariumnsw-pds"</code>). This should be enough for me to find what I’m looking for!</p>
<section id="finding-the-bucket" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finding-the-bucket">Finding the bucket</h3>
<p>Okay, so let’s see if we can find this bucket using R code. The <strong>aws.s3</strong> package contains a handy function called <code>bucket_exists()</code>, which returns <code>TRUE</code> when it finds an S3 bucket at the specified location (and using whatever credentials you currently have available), and <code>FALSE</code> when it does not. That seems relatively easy. We know the name of our bucket, specified more precisely as <code>"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/"</code>, and we can verify that it exists. And of course when we do this it turns out that there…</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb3" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb3-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">bucket_exists</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_e3a69ca1254b73a8dd7425663cec9545">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] FALSE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>…isn’t? Wait, what????</p>
<p>I’ve made a very common mistake here, and forgotten to specify the region. S3 is very picky about regions and you need to tell it explicitly which one to use. The National Herbarium is an Australian institution and the data are stored in Amazon’s Sydney data center. In Amazon parlance, that’s the <code>"ap-southeast-2"</code> region, but unless you’ve done something to set a different default (more on that later), everything you do will probably default to the <code>"us-east-1"</code> region. To override this default, we can explicitly specify the <code>region</code> that <code>bucket_exists()</code> should look in. So now let’s try that again:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb5" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">bucket_exists</span>(</span>
<span id="cb5-2">  <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">bucket =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/"</span>, </span>
<span id="cb5-3">  <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">region =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"ap-southeast-2"</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4">)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_1a73c4405d3c9ae480adf7547d5a3572">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Much better!</p>
</section>
<section id="okay-okay-i-lied" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="okay-okay-i-lied">Okay, okay, I lied…</h3>
<p>One more thing. If you’ve been following along at home and trying out these commands, you’ve probably noticed that the output you’re getting is a little more verbose than simply returning <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>. The actual output comes with a lot of additional metadata, stored as attributes. I didn’t really want to clutter the output by showing all that stuff, so the examples above secretly removed the attributes before printing the results. What you’ll <em>actually</em> see is something like this:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_c8eaf366e80a13f6dff792ad65ab801d">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">bucket_exists</span>(</span>
<span id="cb7-2">  <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">bucket =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/"</span>, </span>
<span id="cb7-3">  <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">region =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"ap-southeast-2"</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4">)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] TRUE
attr(,"x-amz-id-2")
[1] "cr7uaPSaKx4B5BJNRCDIU+Cpns0menZBjxjT5OltIViGFUlStJxSqI5rT1lZfN3ASVz+p4XMalE="

[1] "false"
attr(,"content-type")
[1] "application/xml"
attr(,"server")
[1] "AmazonS3"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>If you stare at this long enough this metadata all starts to make sense, especially after you’ve been playing around with S3 for a while. There’s a timestamp, there’s some information about which region the data came from, and so on. Nothing particularly special or interesting here, so let’s move on to something more fun.</p>
</section>
<section id="listing-bucket-contents" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="listing-bucket-contents">Listing bucket contents</h3>
<p>At this point in the journey we’ve located the bucket, but we have no idea what it contains. To get a list of the bucket contents, the <code>get_bucket_df()</code> function from <strong>aws.s3</strong> is our friend. The National Herbarium data set contains a lot of objects, so I’ll be “frugal” and restrict myself to merely downloading <code>max = 20000</code> records:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/get-bucket_29edbad137ee1cabf7490a6fdc5a38a5">

<p>Wonderful! The very first object in the bucket happens to be a file called <code>ReadMe.txt</code>. Perhaps I should download this marvelous object and perhaps even read it?</p>
</section>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="downloading-files">Downloading files</h3>
<p>Okay then. We are now at the step where we want to download a specific object from the bucket, and save it locally as a file. To do this we use the <code>save_object()</code> function. As before, we specify the <code>bucket</code> and the <code>region</code>, but we’ll also need to specify which <code>object</code> should be downloaded, and the <code>file</code> path to which it should be saved. Here’s how that works for the Read Me file:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/download-readme_81ce5c37bac9d7bb5f34e5324a1e7d65">

</div>
<p>Once again this works and so off I go, reading the Read Me in search of further clues.</p>
<p>As you might hope, the Read Me file does in fact tell us something about how the National Herbarium dataset is organised. In particular, one line in the Read Me informs me that there’s a file storing all the metadata, encoded as a zipped csv file:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A zipped csv containing the biocollections metadata for the images is available as a DarwinCore Archive at: https://herbariumnsw-pds.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dwca-nsw_avh-v1.0.zip</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like a good place to start, doesn’t it? Once again, I’ll use <code>save_object()</code> and try to download the metadata file <code>dwca-nsw_avh-v1.0.zip</code>:</p>

<p>Success!</p>
<p>I now have a copy of the 79MB zip file on my laptop, and after decompressing the file it turns out I have a 402MB file called <code>occurrence.txt</code> that contains the metadata. As it turns out, the metadata aren’t stored in comma-separated value format, they’re stored in tab-separated value format. Still, that’s fine: the <code>read_tsv()</code> function from the <strong>readr</strong> package can handle it:</p>

<p>There’s quite a lot of interesting information stored in the 74 columns of the <code>herbarium</code> data, but I won’t dive very deep into it in this post. I will mention, however, that if you find yourself following along at home you’ll likely discover that there is a small proportion of the 725507 rows that cause problems for <code>read_tsv()</code>, likely because they contain additional tab characters that mess up the parsing slightly. In real life I’d want to look into this, but this is a blog post. Nothing here is real and nobody is watching, right?</p>

<p>Now that I have some data, I can do a little poking around to see what’s in it. Exploring a new data set is always fun, but this isn’t really a post about data wrangling, so I’ll keep this brief. A quick look suggests that (unsurprisingly) there are a lot of records corresponding to samples collected in Australia, and a disproportionate number of those come from New South Wales:</p>

<p>That’s nice, but doesn’t immediately suggest a fun example for me to continue this post. On a whim, I decide to name search my neighbourhood. I live in Newtown (in Sydney), so I’m going to find the subset of images in the National Herbarium data whose locality matches the string <code>"Newtown"</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
<p>Yeah, no. This is misleading.</p>
<p>From a data science point of view I’m being extremely sloppy here. If my intention had been to find only plants from my neighbourhood, I would also be wise to filter by recorded longitude and latitude where available, and I would certainly want to exclude cases listed as coming from another Australian state. “Newtown” is not an uncommon name, and – to the surprise of nobody – it turns out that there are several different locations called “Newtown” in different parts of Australia. Fortunately for me, I really don’t care! All I wanted was a query that would return around 20-30 results, so this is fine for my purposes.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got a subset of records, let’s pull out the catalog numbers:</p>

<p>The Read Me file had something useful to say about these numbers. Specifically, the catalog numbers are used as the basis of the file naming convention for images stored in the bucket:</p>

<p>Okay, now I want to pull the images for these records. First, I’m going to construct the paths. I am <em>not</em> going to download the jp2 files because they’re about 100MB each. Multiplying that number by the number of records gives… well, it gives a big enough number that I think I’ve worked out why the National Herbarium dataset is on S3 and not on a laptop in a damp basement somewhere!</p>
<p>In any case, for a lot of the records there’s a jpg file that is considerably smaller in size, so I’m going to try to download those. Based on the barcodes I’ve got, these are the files I’m expecting to find:</p>

<p>This all seems pretty reasonable, but there’s a nuance here that is worth pointing out. When you look at the output above, it’s tempting to think that <code>"images"</code> must be a subfolder within the S3 bucket. That intuition isn’t correct: each S3 bucket is a flat datastore. It doesn’t contain any subfolders: the <code>"/"</code> is treated as part of the object name, nothing more. It can be convenient to name objects this way, though, because it makes it a little easier to organise them into subfolders later on if you want to move them onto a more traditional hierarchical file system.</p>
<p>Anyway…</p>
<p>Since I’m going to try downloading objects that may or may not actually exist (i.e., I’m not certain if all these records actually have jpg files), I’m going to start out by writing a helper function <code>save_herbarium_image()</code> that does three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it uses the <code>object_exists()</code> function to check if an object with that name exists in this bucket. The <code>object_exists()</code> function works similarly to the <code>bucket_exists()</code> function I used earlier: the only difference is that I also specify the object name.</li>
<li>Second, if the object exists, it downloads the file and stores it locally, in the <code>"herbarium"</code> subfolder in the folder that contains this blog post.</li>
<li>Third, it returns information to the user. If the object exists and was successfully downloaded, it returns a character string specifying the location of the saved file. If the object doesn’t exist, it returns <code>NA</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the code:</p>

<p>That seemed to work well when applied to a single file, so I’ll use the functional programming tools from <strong>purrr</strong> to vectorise the operation. More precisely, I’ll use <code>map_chr()</code> to iterate over all of the <code>objects</code>, applying the <code>save_herbarium_image()</code> function to each one, and collecting the return values from all these function calls into a character vector:</p>

<p>Did it work? Well, kind of. Notice there are some missing values in the output. In those cases the object doesn’t exist in this bucket, and when that happens the <code>save_herbarium_image()</code> function bails and doesn’t try to download anything. But in most cases images it worked.</p>

<p>At this point, I’d like to start displaying the images. It’s nice to have pretty pictures in a blog post, don’t you think? Like, maybe what I could do is include some of those images in this post. One problem though is that the files stored in the National Herbarium dataset are high resolution images and as consequence even the jpg files are usually about 7MB each. That’s a bit excessive, so I think what I’ll do is write a little helper function that reads in each image, resizes it to something smaller, and then saves that smaller file.</p>
<p>If I want to do this within R, the <strong>magick</strong> package is my friend. It’s extremely well suited to this kind of image manipulation task. This post isn’t about the <strong>magick</strong> package, so I’m not going to explain this part of the code,<sup>2</sup> but suffice it to say that this helper function solves the problem:</p>

<p>At this point it is starting to dawn on me that it would be kind of neat to create my own S3 bucket and store the tiny images there. I could make the tiny images public and then display them in this post. The National Herbarium data is released under a Creative Commons By-Attribution licence, so I’m allowed to use the images that way as long as I properly acknowledge the source… which I think is fairly well covered in this post already!</p>
<p>The task I’m going to set for myself later in this post is to do exactly that, and use tools from the <strong>aws.s3</strong> package to do everything in R. However, I can’t do any of that unless I have an AWS account of my very own. The time has come for me to do that.</p>
<section id="creating-the-account" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-the-account">Creating the account</h3>
<p>Signing up for the account turns out to be pretty easy. All I had to do was visit https://aws.amazon.com/s3/ and click on the “Create an AWS Account” button shown in the image below:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>This then led me through a pretty standard sign up process. I had to provide an email address for the “root user” (i.e., me!), specify a password, and so on. I didn’t sign up for anything that cost money. The free tier allows you 5GB of storage for 12 months, which is fairly convenient for “playing around” purposes, and that’s all I’m intending to do here.</p>

<section id="creating-credentials" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-credentials">Creating credentials</h3>
<p>The next step is to create an access key, so that R can interact with S3 using my credentials. At this point a little care is needed. It is possible to create access credentials for the root user, but that’s not a good idea. The root user has access to every AWS service, not just S3, and it’s a bad idea to give R access to any credentials that have those permissions. What I’ll do here is create an an “IAM user” – where “IAM” stands for “Identity and Access Management” – that <em>only</em> has access to my S3 storage, and the credentials I supply to R will be associated with that user. Here’s how I did that. First, I went over to the IAM console here:</p>
<p>https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users</p>
<p>On this screen there’s an “add users” button that I dutifully click…</p>
<div class="cell">

</div>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>From here it’s mostly a matter of following prompts. The screenshot below shows me part way through the creation process. The IAM user has its own username, and it will be allowed programmatic access using an access key:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>When I get to the next screen it asks me to set the permissions associated with this user. I click on “attach existing policies directly”, and then type “S3” into the search box. It comes up with a list of permission policies associated with S3 and I select the one I want:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>The third screen is boring. It asks for tags. I don’t give it any. I move onto the fourth screen, which turns out to be a review screen:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Having decided I am happy with these settings, I click on the “next” button that isn’t actually shown in these screenshots (it’s at the bottom of the page) and it takes me to a final screen that gives me the access key ID and the secret access key:</p>

<p>These are the two pieces of information I need to let R access to my S3 storage.</p>
</section>
<section id="storing-your-aws-credentials-in-r" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="storing-your-aws-credentials-in-r">Storing your AWS credentials in R</h3>
<p>There are several ways of storing these credentials in R. The easiest is to add the credentials to your <code>.Renviron</code> file, which you can conveniently open with the <code>edit_r_environ()</code> function from the <strong>usethis</strong> package. To get access to the account, the following lines need to be added to your <code>.Renviron</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=&lt;your access key id&gt;
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;your secret key&gt;</code></pre>
<p>However, if you’re going to be using the same AWS region all the time (e.g., you’re in Sydney so you tend to use <code>"ap-southeast-2"</code> rather than <code>"us-east-1"</code>), you might as well add a third line that sets your default region. That way, you won’t need to bother manually specifying the <code>region</code> argument every time you want to interact with S3: the <strong>aws.s3</strong> package will use your default. So for me, the relevant lines ended up looking like this:</p>
<pre><code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=&lt;my access key id&gt;
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=&lt;my secret key&gt;
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-southeast-2</code></pre>
<p>After restarting R, these new settings will apply.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="manipulating-your-s3-storage-from-r">Manipulating your S3 storage from R</h2>
<p>Now that I have an AWS account and credentials, I can start using the <strong>aws.s3</strong> package for more than just downloading files. I can create my own buckets, put objects into those buckets, control the access settings for those objects, and a good deal more besides. So let’s give that a go, shall we?</p>
<section id="creating-a-new-bucket" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="creating-a-new-bucket">Creating a new bucket</h3>
<p>The function to create a new bucket is called <code>put_bucket()</code> and now that my credentials are set up it’s almost comically easy to use. If I want to create a bucket called <code>"tiny-herbs"</code>, this is what I do:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb40" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb40-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">put_bucket</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"tiny-herbs"</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>That seems too easy? I am skeptical. I’m convinced that something must have gone wrong, so my first impulse is to use <code>bucket_exists()</code> to verify that it worked. Okay, so… does this new bucket exist?</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb42" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb42-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">bucket_exists</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"s3://tiny-herbs/"</span>) </span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] TRUE
attr(,"x-amz-id-2")
[1] "4B8L2PauxADAbOSyFra5ra/OHwObxniV89yWTPe44PJ0TRjIOdsNQdHl1El1t0/39aSQOyJS1FE="
attr(,"x-amz-request-id")

attr(,"x-amz-access-point-alias")
[1] "false"
attr(,"content-type")
[1] "application/xml"
attr(,"server")
[1] "AmazonS3"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>It does, and notice that both <code>put_bucket()</code> and <code>bucket_exists()</code> have respected my default region setting. When I called <code>put_bucket()</code>, the <strong>aws.s3</strong> package supplied the region from my default and so the bucket was created in Sydney (i.e., “ap-southeast-2”), and it did the same again when I used <code>bucket_exists()</code> to look for the buckets.</p>
<p>So what’s in the bucket? Just like I did with the National Herbarium bucket, I can use the <code>get_bucket_df()</code> function to inspect the contents of my bucket:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb44" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb44-1"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">get_bucket_df</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"s3://tiny-herbs/"</span>) <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">%&gt;%</span> </span>
<span id="cb44-2">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">as_tibble</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<div class="cell">
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code># A tibble: 0 × 8
# … with 8 variables: Key &lt;chr&gt;, LastModified &lt;chr&gt;, ETag &lt;chr&gt;, Size &lt;chr&gt;,
#   Owner_ID &lt;chr&gt;, Owner_DisplayName &lt;chr&gt;, StorageClass &lt;chr&gt;, Bucket &lt;chr&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hm. Well, yes. Of course it’s empty: I haven’t put any objects in it yet. Maybe I should do that? It does seem like a good idea!</p>
<p>But first…</p>
</section>
<section id="managing-access-control" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="managing-access-control">Managing access control</h3>
<p>One thing though… is this private or public? This is governed by the Access Control List (ACL) settings. By default, S3 buckets are set to private. You can read and write to them, but no-one else has any access at all. Let’s soften that slightly, and allow anyone to read from the “tiny-herbs” bucket. I could have done that from the beginning by setting <code>acl = "public-read"</code> when I called <code>put_bucket()</code>. However, because I “forgot” to do that earlier, I’ll change it now using <code>put_acl()</code></p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-29_1fd59396c2d351c8fdf4633241ef6b52">

<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] TRUE</code></pre>

</div>
<p>Now everyone has read access to the bucket.<sup>4</sup></p>
</section>
<section id="adding-objects-to-your-bucket" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="adding-objects-to-your-bucket">Adding objects to your bucket</h3>
<p>To put an object inside my new bucket, the function I need is <code>put_object()</code>. When calling it, I need to specify the local path to the <code>file</code> that I want to upload, the name that the <code>object</code> will be assigned when it is added to the bucket, and of course the <code>bucket</code> itself. This time around, I’ll also explicitly set <code>acl = "public-read"</code> to ensure that – while only I have write access – everyone has read access and can download the object if they want to. Because I’m going to call this repeatedly, I’ll wrap all this in a helper function called <code>put_tiny_image()</code>:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb48" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb48-1">put_tiny_image <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="cf" style="color: #003B4F;">function</span>(file) {</span>
<span id="cb48-2">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">put_object</span>(</span>
<span id="cb48-3">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">file =</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">file.path</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"herbarium"</span>, <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"tiny_images"</span>, file),</span>
<span id="cb48-4">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">object =</span> file, </span>
<span id="cb48-5">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">bucket =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"s3://tiny-herbs/"</span>,</span>
<span id="cb48-6">    <span class="at" style="color: #657422;">acl =</span> <span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"public-read"</span></span>
<span id="cb48-7">  )</span>
<span id="cb48-8">}</span></code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>To see this in action, let’s create a vector that lists the names of all the tiny images, and then apply the <code>put_tiny_image()</code> function to the first one:</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb49" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb49-1">tiny_images <span class="ot" style="color: #003B4F;">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">list.files</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;">"herbarium/tiny_images"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb49-2">tiny_images[<span class="dv" style="color: #AD0000;">1</span>] <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">%&gt;%</span> </span>
<span id="cb49-3">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">put_tiny_image</span>()</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code>[1] TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Okay that seems to work, so once again I’ll use <strong>purrr</strong> to iterate over all the <code>tiny_images</code>, uploading them one by one into my newly-created bucket:</p>
<div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-32_091b93ac8aa084d7681aa0638904c615">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb51" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb51-1">tiny_images <span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;">%&gt;%</span> </span>
<span id="cb51-2">  <span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;">map_lgl</span>(put_tiny_image)</span></code></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">
<pre><code> [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
[16] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>That looks pretty good! I’m seeing nothing but <code>TRUE</code> values in the output so it looks like I’ve successfully uploaded all the tiny images. Now that I’ve done this, I can try calling <code>get_bucket_df()</code> again to inspect the current contents of the bucket:</p>
<div class="cell">

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>At the end of all this you might have all kinds of questions. Questions like, “Danielle, what’s wrong with you?” and “Danielle, is this even your job? Aren’t you supposed to be working on Apache Arrow?” While I could write an entire novel trying to answer the first one, I think I’ll skip over it and move straight onto the second on, because that’s more interesting and doesn’t require anyone to get a therapist.</p>
<p>Although this isn’t a post about Apache Arrow – and so is not directly related to the work I do every day – of the reasons I found myself looking into S3 in the first place is that Arrow is a tool designed to let data scientists work with very large data sets, and S3 is a tool designed to make it easy to store very large data sets. These two things go well together, so much so that the <strong>arrow</strong> R package has its own support for S3 data storage, and many of the data sets that new <strong>arrow</strong> users encounter are stored on S3. From an educational perspective (sorry – I used to be an academic and I can’t help myself) it’s really difficult for people when they need to learn lots of things at the same time. Trying to learn how Arrow works is really hard when you’re still confused about S3. When I started learning Arrow I didn’t know anything about S3, and it was extremely frustrating to have to learn Arrow concepts with all this confusing S3 stuff floating around.</p>
<p>Hence… this post. My main goal here was to talk about S3 as a topic in its own right, and how tools like <strong>aws.s3</strong> allow R users to write code that interacts with S3 data storage. But it’s very handy background knowledge to have if you’re planning to use <strong>arrow</strong> later on.</p>
<p>On top of all that, the <strong>aws.s3</strong> package has a lot more functionality that I haven’t talked about here. You can use it to copy objects from one bucket to another, and delete objects and buckets that you control. You can use it to add tagging metadata, you can use it to configure your S3 bucket as a website (yes, even with all that painful cross-origin resource sharing configuration stuff), and a good deal more besides. It’s a really nice package and I’m glad I took the time to learn it!</p>

<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p>It’s deeply important to me that you read this knowing that I was singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiwDHHcHPh0"><em>Tragedy</em></a> by Steps at the time I wrote this, complete with dramatic hand gestures↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I will, yet again, sigh in frustration that I have to include the <code>on.exit(gc())</code> line. My limited understanding is as follows. The <strong>magick</strong> package provides wrappers to the C++ ImageMagick library, and none of the image manipulation is actually done in R. The objects that get “loaded” are just pointers, and exiting the <code>shrink_herbarium_image()</code> function doesn’t necessarily cause R to release memory. So whenever I’m iterating over many images, R doesn’t release old images from the magick resource cache unless I trigger the garbage collection with <code>gc()</code>. This feels inelegant but I haven’t had time to find a better solution.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>I’m using the <strong>bs4cards</strong> package to display the images in this layout. Oh, and if you click on any image you’ll see a higher resolution version of that image.↩︎</p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>You can specify different ACL settings for each object, if you want to. The <code>put_acl()</code> function also has an <code>object</code> argument that allows you to control the setting for a single object in a bucket.↩︎</p></li>
