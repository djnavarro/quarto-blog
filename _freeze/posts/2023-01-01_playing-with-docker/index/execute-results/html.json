I'd been playing around with some of the images upon which `ghcr.io/djnavarro/arch-r:base` is built earlier (e.g., it's built on an Arch Linux image that I already have on my laptop) and docker is smart enough to realise it only has to download and build some layers. That's a really nice feature. Among other things, it means that if if I try building this image as second time, docker can use the cached copies of the build steps because nothing has changed and it doesn't have to do anything:\n\n``` bash\ndocker build --tag my-system-check system-check\n```\n\n```\nSending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB\nStep 1/3 : FROM ghcr.io/djnavarro/arch-r:base\n ---> c74e54ffdd8c\nStep 2/3 : COPY script.R /home/script.R\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 50c0c119b6d2\nStep 3/3 : CMD Rscript /home/script.R\n ---> Using cache\n ---> fed061a96fec\nSuccessfully built fed061a96fec\nSuccessfully tagged my-system-check:latest\n```\n\n\n\nNext tell docker to run it. Note that I'm referring to the image by name:\n\n``` bash\ndocker run my-system-check\n```\n\n```\nRunning on:\n  Arch Linux\nWith locale:\n  LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8\n  LC_NUMERIC=C\n  LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8\n  LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8\n  LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8\n  LC_MESSAGES=en_US.UTF-8\n  LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8\n  LC_NAME=C\n  LC_ADDRESS=C\n  LC_TELEPHONE=C\n  LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8\n  LC_IDENTIFICATION=C\n````\n\nCompare this to what happens if I run the script outside the docker image:\n\n``` bash\nRscript script.R\n```\n\n```\nRunning on:\n  Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS\nWith locale:\n  LC_CTYPE=en_AU.UTF-8\n  LC_NUMERIC=C\n  LC_TIME=en_AU.UTF-8\n  LC_COLLATE=en_AU.UTF-8\n  LC_MONETARY=en_AU.UTF-8\n  LC_MESSAGES=en_AU.UTF-8\n  LC_PAPER=en_AU.UTF-8\n  LC_NAME=C\n  LC_ADDRESS=C\n  LC_TELEPHONE=C\n  LC_MEASUREMENT=en_AU.UTF-8\n  LC_IDENTIFICATION=C\n```\n\n## Fancier example\n\nLet's take a look at the `test-on-arch` folder where I've stored a slightly fancier project. Here's my dockerfile. Notice that I'm building on top of a slightly different image:\n\n``` dockerfile\nFROM ghcr.io/djnavarro/arch-r:test\n\n# copy the testing script\nCOPY clone-and-check.R /home/clone-and-check.R\n\n# pass args through environment variables\nARG user\nARG repo\nENV user=$user\nENV repo=$repo\n\n# run the testing script\nCMD Rscript /home/clone-and-check.R\n```\n\nThe testing script:\n\n``` r\n# get the system environment variables\nuser <- Sys.getenv(\"user\")\nrepo <- Sys.getenv(\"repo\")\ncran <- Sys.getenv(\"cran\")\n\n# define github url and a path for the local package install\nurl <- paste(\"https://github.com\", user, repo, sep = \"/\")\ndir <- paste(\"/home/project\", repo, sep=\"/\")\n\n# clone repo, install dependencies, and run checks\ngert::git_clone(url, dir, verbose = TRUE)\nremotes::install_deps(dir, dependencies = TRUE, repos = cran)\nrcmdcheck::rcmdcheck(dir)\n```\n\nI've never downloaded the test image, but I've already built the base image on my local machine and the test image is essentially the same as the base but with some extra system and R dependencies added. Let's see what happens when I try to build:\n\n``` bash\ndocker build \\\n  --tag test-queue \\\n  --build-arg user=djnavarro \\\n  --build-arg repo=queue \\\n  test-on-arch\n```\n\n```\nSending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB\nStep 1/7 : FROM ghcr.io/djnavarro/arch-r:test\ntest: Pulling from djnavarro/arch-r\n597018910566: Already exists \n8150bcc6bc64: Already exists \nc2ff38743c81: Already exists \nc5dd676c14d5: Already exists \nf30b21a3d71a: Already exists \n8545f2705041: Already exists \nd64243188ff1: Pull complete \n98bfb679f27b: Pull complete \n6627d8db8438: Pull complete \nDigest: sha256:9eb6e1c28f7ebe30acbd320fe2d47ca8e356bdc582e633bd3b55eaab0ef03bc0\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for ghcr.io/djnavarro/arch-r:test\n ---> 549fdff95a53\nStep 2/7 : COPY clone-and-check.R /home/clone-and-check.R\n ---> 90635e60ba89\nStep 3/7 : ARG user\n ---> Running in 19c6fd3b47ce\nRemoving intermediate container 19c6fd3b47ce\n ---> aaf0a7677e56\nStep 4/7 : ARG repo\n ---> Running in 9ea3246bded6\nRemoving intermediate container 9ea3246bded6\n ---> edfa009a9757\nStep 5/7 : ENV user=$user\n ---> Running in ea2dcd08d511\nRemoving intermediate container ea2dcd08d511\n ---> 738933de7e6c\nStep 6/7 : ENV repo=$repo\n ---> Running in fe9b2b07a311\nRemoving intermediate container fe9b2b07a311\n ---> 9361bae891f3\nStep 7/7 : CMD Rscript /home/clone-and-check.R\n ---> Running in ffdb933cf785\nRemoving intermediate container ffdb933cf785\n ---> 9fbbbbe1188d\nSuccessfully built 9fbbbbe1188d\nSuccessfully tagged test-queue:latest\n```\n\nIt downloads, but this is a much larger image because the testing environment has tex-live installed on it (among other things) and it's a few GB in size. This one isn't a frugal image! It takes a while but the nice thing is that if you've done it once you don't have to do it again.\n\n\nAs a little sanity check -- because, dear reader, I have been sitting here waiting very patiently while a large image downloaded over a slow connection and would like to confirm that I don't have to do that again -- let's repeat the exercise from earlier and try building it a second time:\n\n``` bash\ndocker build \\\n  --tag test-queue \\\n  --build-arg user=djnavarro \\\n  --build-arg repo=queue \\\n  test-on-arch \n```\n\n```\nSending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB\nStep 1/7 : FROM ghcr.io/djnavarro/arch-r:test\n ---> 549fdff95a53\nStep 2/7 : COPY clone-and-check.R /home/clone-and-check.R\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 90635e60ba89\nStep 3/7 : ARG user\n ---> Using cache\n ---> aaf0a7677e56\nStep 4/7 : ARG repo\n ---> Using cache\n ---> edfa009a9757\nStep 5/7 : ENV user=$user\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 738933de7e6c\nStep 6/7 : ENV repo=$repo\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 9361bae891f3\nStep 7/7 : CMD Rscript /home/clone-and-check.R\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 9fbbbbe1188d\nSuccessfully built 9fbbbbe1188d\nSuccessfully tagged test-queue:latest\n```\n\nNot going to lie, I breathed a little sigh of relief. Docker used the cached layers, and that all happened instantaneously. \n\nNow let's run it:\n\n``` bash\ndocker run test-queue\n```\n\n```\nTransferred 766 of 766 objects...done!\nChecked out 34 of 34 commits... done!\n\n── R CMD build ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n* checking for file ‘.../DESCRIPTION’ ...

I haven't gotten around to dealing with that note yet, so this is no different to what I'd get if I'd run it on Ubuntu. The one part that is slightly different is this:\n\n```\nSystem has not been booted with systemd as init system (PID 1). Can't operate.\nFailed to connect to bus: Host is down\nWarning: Your system is mis-configured: ‘/var/db/timezone/localtime’ is not a symlink\nWarning: ‘/var/db/timezone/localtime’ is not identical to any known timezone file\nWarning message:\nIn system(\"timedatectl\", intern = TRUE) :\n  running command 'timedatectl' had status 1\n```\n\nYeah. I deliberately didn't try to faff about with systemd in these images, so this is an expected warning. It's not a problem with queue or with Arch, just a consequence of how I built the images. That would have some consequences for testing a lot of packages, but I'm not trying to recreate the rocker project here so I'm not too fussed about it in this little exercise.\n\nThe advantage to passing arguments is that you can build many images from the same dockerfile, and docker will reuse the cached layers intelligently. Even though I've never tried testing the praise package on Arch before, this builds immediately and without downloading anything, because everything that actually matters was already done when I built the \"test-queue\" image earlier:\n\n``` bash\ndocker build \\\n  --tag test-praise \\\n  --build-arg user=rladies \\\n  --build-arg repo=praise \\\n  test-on-arch \n```\n\n```\nSending build context to Docker daemon  3.072kB\nStep 1/7 : FROM ghcr.io/djnavarro/arch-r:test\n ---> 549fdff95a53\nStep 2/7 : COPY clone-and-check.R /home/clone-and-check.R\n ---> Using cache\n ---> 90635e60ba89\nStep 3/7 : ARG user\n ---> Using cache\n ---> aaf0a7677e56\nStep 4/7 : ARG repo\n ---> Using cache\n ---> edfa009a9757\nStep 5/7 : ENV user=$user\n ---> Running in fee7736cc9b3\nRemoving intermediate container fee7736cc9b3\n ---> 4b17eb3a42ed\nStep 6/7 : ENV repo=$repo\n ---> Running in 6e7686a3cc31\nRemoving intermediate container 6e7686a3cc31\n ---> 5182d4b98223\nStep 7/7 : CMD Rscript /home/clone-and-check.R\n ---> Running in 1caac213f8b0\nRemoving intermediate container 1caac213f8b0\n ---> 2a6dc9df46f4\nSuccessfully built 2a6dc9df46f4\nSuccessfully tagged test-praise:latest\n```\n\nIt's verbose, but fast, and it hasn't wasted anything by creating unnecessary copies.

What about ggplot2? That has extra dependencies that aren't included in the test image. Let's see...\n\n``` bash\ndocker build \\\n  --tag test-ggplot2 \\\n  --build-arg user=tidyverse \\\n  --build-arg repo=ggplot2 \\\n  test-on-arch \n```\n\nI'll skip the output this time because it's not interesting. Now let's run it and...\n\n``` bash\ndocker run test-ggplot2 \n```\n```\nTransferred 15676 of 74694 objects...\n```\n\n...uh, right. Look this is going to take a while so maybe we should move on? \n\nThe main reason I wanted to point to this is to highlight that this part is happening at run time: we're always downloading a fresh copy of the repository to run the tests. That makes sense in some context, but not others. The design choices I made in designing this docker image aren't the same ones I'd make if I was trying to design something that would work for a larger project.^[I mean, you could certainly write something similar as part of a containerised workflow on GitHub Actions that works similarly to existing workflows for R CMD check but executed within a container running Arch. That doesn't seem out of the question, but this isn't the way you'd set it up!] It's a toy, nothing more!^[I know the mystery will be too much so I'd better resolve it: no, it didn't pass on the Arch image. Some of the dependencies didn't install properly, and then eventually it threw an error trying to build the vignettes.]\n\n\n\n## Hosting images\n\nEdit the github PAT to include the scopes we need. If you've created your PAT using the default scopes provided by `usethis::create_github_token()`, you'll need a few more to run workflows that build and modify docker images:\n\n- `read:packages` scope to download container images and read metadata.\n- `write:packages` scope to download and upload container images and read and write metadata.\n- `delete:packages` scope to delete container images.\n\nAdd the GitHub Actions workflow, commit whatever changes you want to the repo. When you push upstream to main, it will trigger an automatic deployment to the GitHub Container Registry. In fact, if you look at how I set up\n[github.com/djnavarro/arch-r](https://github.com/djnavarro/arch-r) you'll notice that's exactly how it works there. You can also take a look at the more sophisticated workflows used by the rocker project: [github.com/rocker-org/rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker). The workflow I set up for my little side project is very simple by comparison.\n\n## Resources\n\n- The docker reference documentation: [docs.docker.com/reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/)\n\n- Instructions on giving docker sudo privileges for linux users: [docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)\n\n- The rocker project by Carl Boettiger, Dirk Eddelbuettel, Noam Ross, and Shima Tatsuya: [rocker-project.org](https://rocker-project.org/)\n\n- Source code for the rocker repositories: [github.com/rocker-org/rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker)\n\n- Blog post on docker by Colin Fay: [colinfay.me/docker-r-reproducibility](https://colinfay.me/docker-r-reproducibility/)\n\n- Slides on docker by Noam Ross: [github.com/noamross/nyhackr-docker-talk](https://github.com/noamross/nyhackr-docker-talk)\n\n- Docker for beginners by Prakhar Srivastav: [docker-curriculum.com](https://docker-curriculum.com/)\n\n- Working with GitHub Container Registry:\n[docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry)\n\n\n\n<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->\n",
