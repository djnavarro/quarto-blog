Thankfully, it's not\n  like that at all. With the help of the aws.s3 package,\n  you can manage cloud data storage from R with surprisingly\n  little pain.\ndate: 2022-03-17\nimage: preview-image.jpg\ncategories: [Amazon S3]\ncitation:\n  url: https://blog.djnavarro.net/using-aws-s3-in-r \nformat:\n  html:\n    css: \"strapless.css\"\nparams:\n  slug: using-aws-s3-in-r\n  date: 2022-03-17\n---\n\n\n<!--------------- setup post ----------------->\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!--------------- post ----------------->\n\nI have a shameful confession to make, one that may shock and surprise you. Although I am an R user, data scientist, and developer of many years experience, I've never used Amazon Web Services.\n\nIt's hard to believe, I know, but I've never spun up a virtual machine on \"Amazon EC2\" (...whatever _that_ is), I don't know what \"AWS Lambda\" is, and the only thing I know about \"Amazon S3\" is that fancy data science people use it to store data. Or something along those lines. Honestly, I really haven't been paying attention. Every time people start talking about it my eyes glaze over and my impostor syndrome arrives to berate me. A *true* data scientist is born knowing how to spin up EC2 instances, and if baby doesn't post her drawings on S3 then she's already falling behind, etc etc. It's terribly stressful.\n\nMy dark and terrible personal tragedy notwithstanding,^[It's deeply important to me that you read this knowing that I was singing [*Tragedy*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiwDHHcHPh0) by Steps at the time I wrote this, complete with dramatic hand gestures] I suspect my situation is not entirely uncommon. Back in my academic days, I knew very few people who used Amazon Web Services (a.k.a. AWS) for much of anything. It wasn't needed, so it wasn't knowledge that people acquired. Now that I'm working in an industry setting I'm finding that it's _so_ widely used that it's almost assumed knowledge. _Everyone_ knows this stuff, so there's not a lot said about why you might care, or how to get started using these tools if you decide that you do care. \n\nToday I decided to do something about this, starting by teaching myself how to use Amazon's Simple Storage Service (a.k.a S3). With the help of the [**aws.s3**](https://github.com/cloudyr/aws.s3) package authored by Thomas Leeper and currently maintained by Simon Urbanek, it's surprisingly easy to do.\n\nIn this post I'll walk you through the process.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(purrr)\nlibrary(stringr)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(magick)\nlibrary(aws.s3)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://tiny-herbs.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/NSW687458.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n## What is S3 and why do I care?\n\nLet's get started. As with everything else in life, the place to start is asking yourself if you even care. I mean, if we don't care what S3 is or what it does, why even bother? Just let your eyes glaze over as the nerd keeps talking and wonder if there's anything good on TV...\n\nStill here? Cool. \n\nFrom the user perspective, Amazon's \"Simple Storage Service\" isn't particularly complicated. It's just a remote storage system that you can dump files into, kind of like a programmable Dropbox. Each file (and its accompanying metadata) is stored as an *object*, and collections of objects are grouped together into a *bucket*. If you want to store files on S3, all you need to do is open an account, create a new bucket, and upload your files. It's exactly that boring, and the only reason anyone cares (as far as I know) is that Amazon designed this to work at scale and it's fairly easy to write scripts that allow you to control the whole thing programmatically. Which is actually a pretty handy service, now that I think about it!\n\n<br>\n\n## Downloading public data from S3\n\nThe first thing to understand about S3 is that there's many different ways of using it. Very often, you're not interested in storing your own data on S3. You might just want to download data that someone else has stored, and if that data has been made publicly accessible, then you don't even need an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account at all. You can download to your hearts content. For a data scientist it's a fun way to start, because you get to dive straight into playing with data insted of fiddling about with accounts and credentials and all those dull things. \n\nSo let's find a public data set to play with. While browsing through the registry of open data sets listed on the S3 website I came across the [National Herbarium of NSW data set](https://registry.opendata.aws/nsw-herbarium/). As described on the website:\n\n> The National Herbarium of New South Wales is one of the most significant scientific, cultural and historical botanical resources in the Southern hemisphere. The 1.43 million preserved plant specimens have been captured as high-resolution images and the biodiversity metadata associated with each of the images captured in digital form. Botanical specimens date from year 1770 to today, and form voucher collections that document the distribution and diversity of the world's flora through time, particularly that of NSW, Austalia and the Pacific. The data is used in biodiversity assessment, systematic botanical research, ecosystem conservation and policy development. The data is used by scientists, students and the public.\n\nAs an example, here's one of the images stored in the data set, of a plant specimen collected quite close to where I currently live, albeit quite a long time ago:\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://tiny-herbs.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/NSW29246.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\nSo yeah, I love this data set already and I want to play with it. But how do I do that? I've never done anything with S3 before and it's all a bit new to me. Well, on the right hand side of the listing page for the National Herbarium data, there's a section that contains the following metadata:\n\n```\nDescription\nHerbarium Collection Image files\n\nResource type\nS3 Bucket\n\nAmazon Resource Name (ARN)\narn:aws:s3:::herbariumnsw-pds\n\nAWS Region\nap-southeast-2\n```\n\nUsing this information, I can get started. I know *what* the data is (an S3 bucket), I know *where* the data is (in the `\"ap-southeast-2\"` region), and on top of that I know the *name* of the data (`\"herbariumnsw-pds\"`). This should be enough for me to find what I'm looking for!\n\n\n### Finding the bucket\n\nOkay, so let's see if we can find this bucket using R code. The **aws.s3** package contains a handy function called `bucket_exists()`, which returns `TRUE` when it finds an S3 bucket at the specified location (and using whatever credentials you currently have available), and `FALSE` when it does not. That seems relatively easy. We know the name of our bucket, specified more precisely as  `\"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/\"`, and we can verify that it exists. And of course when we do this it turns out that there...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbucket_exists(\"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-5_e3a69ca1254b73a8dd7425663cec9545'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n...isn't? Wait, what???? \n\nI've made a very common mistake here, and forgotten to specify the region. S3 is very picky about regions and you need to tell it explicitly which one to use. The National Herbarium is an Australian institution and the data are stored in Amazon's Sydney data center. In Amazon parlance, that's the `\"ap-southeast-2\"` region, but unless you've done something to set a different default (more on that later), everything you do will probably default to the `\"us-east-1\"` region. To override this default, we can explicitly specify the `region` that `bucket_exists()` should look in. So now let's try that again:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbucket_exists(\n  bucket = \"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/\", \n  region = \"ap-southeast-2\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-7_1a73c4405d3c9ae480adf7547d5a3572'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMuch better!\n\n### Okay, okay, I lied...\n\nOne more thing. If you've been following along at home and trying out these commands, you've probably noticed that the output you're getting is a little more verbose than simply returning `TRUE` or `FALSE`. The actual output comes with a lot of additional metadata, stored as attributes. I didn't really want to clutter the output by showing all that stuff, so the examples above secretly removed the attributes before printing the results. What you'll *actually* see is something like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_c8eaf366e80a13f6dff792ad65ab801d'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbucket_exists(\n  bucket = \"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/\", \n  region = \"ap-southeast-2\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\nattr(,\"x-amz-id-2\")\n[1] \"cr7uaPSaKx4B5BJNRCDIU+Cpns0menZBjxjT5OltIViGFUlStJxSqI5rT1lZfN3ASVz+p4XMalE=\"\nattr(,\"x-amz-request-id\")\n[1] \"AE47G6MWJA7NRMYJ\"\nattr(,\"date\")\n[1] \"Fri, 22 Apr 2022 09:04:11 GMT\"\nattr(,\"x-amz-bucket-region\")\n[1] \"ap-southeast-2\"\nattr(,\"x-amz-access-point-alias\")\n[1] \"false\"\nattr(,\"content-type\")\n[1] \"application/xml\"\nattr(,\"server\")\n[1] \"AmazonS3\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you stare at this long enough this metadata all starts to make sense, especially after you've been playing around with S3 for a while. There's a timestamp, there's some information about which region the data came from, and so on. Nothing particularly special or interesting here, so let's move on to something more fun.\n\n### Listing bucket contents\n\nAt this point in the journey we've located the bucket, but we have no idea what it contains. To get a list of the bucket contents, the `get_bucket_df()` function from **aws.s3** is our friend. The National Herbarium data set contains a lot of objects, so I'll be \"frugal\" and restrict myself to merely downloading `max = 20000` records:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/get-bucket_29edbad137ee1cabf7490a6fdc5a38a5'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nherbarium_files <- get_bucket_df(\n  bucket = \"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/\", \n  region = \"ap-southeast-2\", \n  max = 20000\n) %>% \n  as_tibble()\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow that we've downloaded a list of the bucket contents, let's have a look and see what we've got:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nherbarium_files\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 20,000 × 8\n   Key                        LastM…¹ ETag  Size  Owner…² Owner…³ Stora…⁴ Bucket\n   <chr>                      <chr>   <chr> <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>   <chr> \n 1 ReadMe.txt                 2020-0… \"\\\"5… 2729  97c09b… herbar… STANDA… herba…\n 2 dwca-nsw_avh-v1.0.zip      2019-1… \"\\\"2… 8231… 97c09b… herbar… STANDA… herba…\n 3 herbariumnsw-pds/PublicDa… 2021-0… \"\\\"3… 33    <NA>    <NA>    STANDA… herba…\n 4 herbariumnsw-pds/PublicDa… 2021-0… \"\\\"5… 433   <NA>    <NA>    STANDA… herba…\n 5 herbariumnsw-pds/PublicDa… 2021-0… \"\\\"5… 33    <NA>    <NA>    STANDA… herba…\n 6 herbariumnsw-pds/PublicDa… 2021-0… \"\\\"f… 433   <NA>    <NA>    STANDA… herba…\n 7 herbariumnsw-pds/PublicDa… 2021-0… \"\\\"b… 33    <NA>    <NA>    STANDA… herba…\n 8 herbariumnsw-pds/PublicDa… 2021-0… \"\\\"4… 433   <NA>    <NA>    STANDA… herba…\n 9 herbariumnsw-pds/PublicDa… 2021-0… \"\\\"f… 33    <NA>    <NA>    STANDA… herba…\n10 herbariumnsw-pds/PublicDa… 2021-0… \"\\\"6… 433   <NA>    <NA>    STANDA… herba…\n# … with 19,990 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​LastModified,\n#   ²​Owner_ID, ³​Owner_DisplayName, ⁴​StorageClass\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWonderful! The very first object in the bucket happens to be a file called `ReadMe.txt`. Perhaps I should download this marvelous object and perhaps even read it?\n\n### Downloading files\n\nOkay then. We are now at the step where we want to download a specific object from the bucket, and save it locally as a file. To do this we use the `save_object()` function. As before, we specify the `bucket` and the `region`, but we'll also need to specify which `object` should be downloaded, and the `file` path to which it should be saved. Here's how that works for the Read Me file:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/download-readme_81ce5c37bac9d7bb5f34e5324a1e7d65'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsave_object(\n  object = \"ReadMe.txt\",\n  bucket = \"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/\", \n  region = \"ap-southeast-2\",\n  file = \"herbarium/ReadMe.txt\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"herbarium/ReadMe.txt\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOnce again this works and so off I go, reading the Read Me in search of further clues. \n\nAs you might hope, the Read Me file does in fact tell us something about how the National Herbarium dataset is organised. In particular, one line in the Read Me informs me that there's a file storing all the metadata, encoded as a zipped csv file: \n\n> A zipped csv containing the biocollections metadata for the images is available as a DarwinCore Archive at: https://herbariumnsw-pds.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/dwca-nsw_avh-v1.0.zip\n\nThis sounds like a good place to start, doesn't it? Once again, I'll use `save_object()` and try to download the metadata file `dwca-nsw_avh-v1.0.zip`:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/download-metadata_4619822fca60c9a956d63567a42bf781'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsave_object(\n  object = \"dwca-nsw_avh-v1.0.zip\",\n  bucket = \"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/\", \n  region = \"ap-southeast-2\",\n  file = \"herbarium/dwca-nsw_avh-v1.0.zip\"\n) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"herbarium/dwca-nsw_avh-v1.0.zip\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSuccess! \n\nI now have a copy of the 79MB zip file on my laptop, and after decompressing the file it turns out I have a 402MB file called `occurrence.txt` that contains the metadata. As it turns out, the metadata aren't stored in comma-separated value format, they're stored in tab-separated value format. Still, that's fine: the `read_tsv()` function from the **readr** package can handle it:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/read-data_1e0738550c63a961802caf74734b1c07'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nherbarium <- read_tsv(\"herbarium/dwca-nsw_avh-v1.0/occurrence.txt\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: One or more parsing issues, see `problems()` for details\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nRows: 725507 Columns: 74\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \"\\t\"\nchr  (38): id, type, institutionCode, collectionCode, basisOfRecord, occurre...\ndbl   (7): minimumElevationInMeters, maximumElevationInMeters, minimumDepthI...\nlgl  (28): lifeStage, associatedSequences, associatedTaxa, previousIdentific...\ndttm  (1): modified\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nherbarium\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 725,507 × 74\n   id     type  modified            institutionCode collectionCode basisOfRecord\n   <chr>  <chr> <dttm>              <chr>           <chr>          <chr>        \n 1 NSW:N… Phys… 2013-11-28 11:56:00 NSW             NSW            PreservedSpe…\n 2 NSW:N… Phys… 2012-08-09 15:47:00 NSW             NSW            PreservedSpe…\n 3 NSW:N… Phys… 2015-03-13 15:51:00 NSW             NSW            PreservedSpe…\n 4 NSW:N… Phys… 2018-07-24 10:06:00 NSW             NSW            PreservedSpe…\n 5 NSW:N… Phys… 2015-03-13 15:51:00 NSW             NSW            PreservedSpe…\n 6 NSW:N… Phys… 2013-07-24 15:16:00 NSW             NSW            PreservedSpe…\n 7 NSW:N… Phys… 2015-03-13 15:51:00 NSW             NSW            PreservedSpe…\n 8 NSW:N… Phys… 2010-12-01 14:25:00 NSW             NSW            PreservedSpe…\n 9 NSW:N… Phys… 2018-01-24 16:49:00 NSW             NSW            PreservedSpe…\n10 NSW:N… Phys… 2018-07-24 10:05:00 NSW             NSW            PreservedSpe…\n# … with 725,497 more rows, and 68 more variables: occurrenceID <chr>,\n#   catalogNumber <chr>, occurrenceRemarks <chr>, recordNumber <chr>,\n#   recordedBy <chr>, lifeStage <lgl>, reproductiveCondition <chr>,\n#   establishmentMeans <chr>, occurrenceStatus <chr>, preparations <chr>,\n#   associatedSequences <lgl>, associatedTaxa <lgl>,\n#   previousIdentifications <lgl>, eventDate <chr>, verbatimEventDate <chr>,\n#   habitat <chr>, eventRemarks <lgl>, continent <lgl>, waterBody <lgl>, …\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere's quite a lot of interesting information stored in the 74 columns of the `herbarium` data, but I won't dive very deep into it in this post. I will mention, however, that if you find yourself following along at home you'll likely discover that there is a small proportion of the 725507 rows that cause problems for `read_tsv()`, likely because they contain additional tab characters that mess up the parsing slightly. In real life I'd want to look into this, but this is a blog post. Nothing here is real and nobody is watching, right?\n\n### Wrangling the data\n\nNow that I have some data, I can do a little poking around to see what's in it. Exploring a new data set is always fun, but this isn't really a post about data wrangling, so I'll keep this brief. A quick look suggests that (unsurprisingly) there are a lot of records corresponding to samples collected in Australia, and a disproportionate number of those come from New South Wales:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nherbarium %>% \n  filter(country == \"Australia\") %>% \n  count(stateProvince)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 10 × 2\n   stateProvince                     n\n   <chr>                         <int>\n 1 Australian Capital Territory     52\n 2 External Territories           1549\n 3 New South Wales              394439\n 4 Northern Territory            28922\n 5 Queensland                    89016\n 6 South Australia               20206\n 7 Tasmania                      23994\n 8 Victoria                      40984\n 9 Western Australia             80447\n10 <NA>                           4287\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat's nice, but doesn't immediately suggest a fun example for me to continue this post. On a whim, I decide to name search my neighbourhood. I live in Newtown (in Sydney), so I'm going to find the subset of images in the National Herbarium data whose locality matches the string `\"Newtown\"`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnewtowners <- herbarium %>% \n  filter(\n    country == \"Australia\", \n    locality %>% str_detect(\"Newtown\")\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nYeah, no. This is misleading.\n\nFrom a data science point of view I'm being extremely sloppy here. If my intention had been to find only plants from my neighbourhood, I would also be wise to filter by recorded longitude and latitude where available, and I would certainly want to exclude cases listed as coming from another Australian state. \"Newtown\" is not an uncommon name, and -- to the surprise of nobody -- it turns out that there are several different locations called \"Newtown\" in different parts of Australia. Fortunately for me, I really don't care! All I wanted was a query that would return around 20-30 results, so this is fine for my purposes. \n\nNow that we've got a subset of records, let's pull out the catalog numbers:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnewtowners %>% \n  pull(catalogNumber)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"NSW 395530\"  \"NSW 461895\"  \"NSW 650052\"  \"NSW 1055313\" \"NSW 1056305\"\n [6] \"NSW 29246\"   \"NSW 36860\"   \"NSW 39618\"   \"NSW 687458\"  \"NSW 121207\" \n[11] \"NSW 214616\"  \"NSW 306564\"  \"NSW 307215\"  \"NSW 389387\"  \"NSW 395529\" \n[16] \"NSW 402973\"  \"NSW 403188\"  \"NSW 404127\"  \"NSW 421494\"  \"NSW 446243\" \n[21] \"NSW 570557\"  \"NSW 702035\"  \"NSW 676197\"  \"NSW 776212\"  \"NSW 777249\" \n[26] \"NSW 739455\"  \"NSW 751830\" \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe Read Me file had something useful to say about these numbers. Specifically, the catalog numbers are used as the basis of the file naming convention for images stored in the bucket:\n\n> Image data are organized by NSW specimen barcode number. For example, the file for Dodonaea lobulata recorded on 1968-09-07 = NSW 041500 can be accessed via the URI \nhttps://herbariumnsw-pds.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/images/NSW041500.jp2\n\nHm. I wonder if I can write code to extract these images?\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://tiny-herbs.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/NSW307215.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n### Scripting the download\n\nOkay, now I want to pull the images for these records. First, I'm going to construct the paths. I am *not* going to download the jp2 files because they're about 100MB each. Multiplying that number by the number of records gives... well, it gives a big enough number that I think I've worked out why the National Herbarium dataset is on S3 and not on a laptop in a damp basement somewhere! \n\nIn any case, for a lot of the records there's a jpg file that is considerably smaller in size, so I'm going to try to download those. Based on the barcodes I've got, these are the files I'm expecting to find: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobjects <- newtowners %>%\n  pull(catalogNumber) %>% \n  str_remove_all(\" \") %>% \n  str_c(\"images/\", ., \".jpg\")\n\nobjects\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"images/NSW395530.jpg\"  \"images/NSW461895.jpg\"  \"images/NSW650052.jpg\" \n [4] \"images/NSW1055313.jpg\" \"images/NSW1056305.jpg\" \"images/NSW29246.jpg\"  \n [7] \"images/NSW36860.jpg\"   \"images/NSW39618.jpg\"   \"images/NSW687458.jpg\" \n[10] \"images/NSW121207.jpg\"  \"images/NSW214616.jpg\"  \"images/NSW306564.jpg\" \n[13] \"images/NSW307215.jpg\"  \"images/NSW389387.jpg\"  \"images/NSW395529.jpg\" \n[16] \"images/NSW402973.jpg\"  \"images/NSW403188.jpg\"  \"images/NSW404127.jpg\" \n[19] \"images/NSW421494.jpg\"  \"images/NSW446243.jpg\"  \"images/NSW570557.jpg\" \n[22] \"images/NSW702035.jpg\"  \"images/NSW676197.jpg\"  \"images/NSW776212.jpg\" \n[25] \"images/NSW777249.jpg\"  \"images/NSW739455.jpg\"  \"images/NSW751830.jpg\" \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis all seems pretty reasonable, but there's a nuance here that is worth pointing out. When you look at the output above, it's tempting to think that `\"images\"` must be a subfolder within the S3 bucket. That intuition isn't correct: each S3 bucket is a flat datastore. It doesn't contain any subfolders: the `\"/\"` is treated as part of the object name, nothing more. It can be convenient to name objects this way, though, because it makes it a little easier to organise them into subfolders later on if you want to move them onto a more traditional hierarchical file system. \n\nAnyway... \n\nSince I'm going to try downloading objects that may or may not actually exist (i.e., I'm not certain if all these records actually have jpg files), I'm going to start out by writing a helper function `save_herbarium_image()` that does three things:\n\n- First, it uses the `object_exists()` function to check if an object with that name exists in this bucket. The `object_exists()` function works similarly to the `bucket_exists()` function I used earlier: the only difference is that I also specify the object name. \n- Second, if the object exists, it downloads the file and stores it locally, in the `\"herbarium\"` subfolder in the folder that contains this blog post. \n- Third, it returns information to the user. If the object exists and was successfully downloaded, it returns a character string specifying the location of the saved file. If the object doesn't exist, it returns `NA`. \n\nHere's the code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsave_herbarium_image <- function(file) {\n  \n  # if object doesn't exist in bucket, return NA\n  ok <- object_exists(\n    object = file,\n    bucket = \"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/\", \n    region = \"ap-southeast-2\"\n  )\n  if(!ok) return(NA_character_)\n  \n  # if object exists, save it and return file path\n  save_object(\n      object = file,\n      bucket = \"s3://herbariumnsw-pds/\", \n      region = \"ap-southeast-2\",\n      file = paste0(\"herbarium/\", file)\n  )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd here it is applied to the first file:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobjects[1] %>% \n  save_herbarium_image()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"herbarium/images/NSW395530.jpg\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat seemed to work well when applied to a single file, so I'll use the functional programming tools from **purrr** to vectorise the operation. More precisely, I'll use `map_chr()` to iterate over all of the `objects`, applying the `save_herbarium_image()` function to each one, and collecting the return values from all these function calls into a character vector:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-15_3834f1bc9f251eaafda5d7a5284b7f7e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobjects %>% \n  map_chr(save_herbarium_image)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nClient error: (404) Not Found\nClient error: (404) Not Found\nClient error: (404) Not Found\nClient error: (404) Not Found\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"herbarium/images/NSW395530.jpg\"  \"herbarium/images/NSW461895.jpg\" \n [3] \"herbarium/images/NSW650052.jpg\"  \"herbarium/images/NSW1055313.jpg\"\n [5] NA                                \"herbarium/images/NSW29246.jpg\"  \n [7] \"herbarium/images/NSW36860.jpg\"   \"herbarium/images/NSW39618.jpg\"  \n [9] \"herbarium/images/NSW687458.jpg\"  \"herbarium/images/NSW121207.jpg\" \n[11] \"herbarium/images/NSW214616.jpg\"  \"herbarium/images/NSW306564.jpg\" \n[13] \"herbarium/images/NSW307215.jpg\"  \"herbarium/images/NSW389387.jpg\" \n[15] NA                                \"herbarium/images/NSW402973.jpg\" \n[17] \"herbarium/images/NSW403188.jpg\"  \"herbarium/images/NSW404127.jpg\" \n[19] NA                                \"herbarium/images/NSW446243.jpg\" \n[21] \"herbarium/images/NSW570557.jpg\"  \"herbarium/images/NSW702035.jpg\" \n[23] \"herbarium/images/NSW676197.jpg\"  \"herbarium/images/NSW776212.jpg\" \n[25] \"herbarium/images/NSW777249.jpg\"  \"herbarium/images/NSW739455.jpg\" \n[27] NA                               \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDid it work? Well, kind of. Notice there are some missing values in the output. In those cases the object doesn't exist in this bucket, and when that happens the `save_herbarium_image()` function bails and doesn't try to download anything. But in most cases images it worked.\n\n### A minor irritant appears!\n\nAt this point, I'd like to start displaying the images. It's nice to have pretty pictures in a blog post, don't you think? Like, maybe what I could do is include some of those images in this post. One problem though is that the files stored in the National Herbarium dataset are high resolution images and as consequence even the jpg files are usually about 7MB each. That's a bit excessive, so I think what I'll do is write a little helper function that reads in each image, resizes it to something smaller, and then saves that smaller file. \n\nIf I want to do this within R, the **magick** package is my friend. It's extremely well suited to this kind of image manipulation task. This post isn't about the **magick** package, so I'm not going to explain this part of the code,^[I will, yet again, sigh in frustration that I have to include the     `on.exit(gc())` line. My limited understanding is as follows. The **magick** package provides wrappers to the C++ ImageMagick library, and none of the image manipulation is actually done in R. The objects that get \"loaded\" are just pointers, and exiting the `shrink_herbarium_image()` function doesn't necessarily cause R to release memory. So whenever I'm iterating over many images, R doesn't release old images from the magick resource cache unless I trigger the garbage collection with `gc()`. This feels inelegant but I haven't had time to find a better solution.] but suffice it to say that this helper function solves the problem:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nshrink_herbarium_image <- function(file) {\n  on.exit(gc())\n  img_from <- file.path(\"herbarium\", \"images\", file)\n  img_to <- file.path(\"herbarium\", \"tiny_images\", file)\n  image_read(img_from) %>% \n    image_resize(geometry_size_pixels(width = 1000)) %>% \n    image_write(img_to)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow that I have this function, I can iterate over every image stored in my local `images` folder, shrink it, and save the small version to the `tiny_images` folder:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-17_8ed24bec88d65d45ecb0f8d2bc6bb9b3'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlist.files(\"herbarium/images\") %>% \n  map_chr(shrink_herbarium_image)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW1055313.jpg\"\n [2] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW121207.jpg\" \n [3] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW214616.jpg\" \n [4] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW29246.jpg\"  \n [5] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW306564.jpg\" \n [6] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW307215.jpg\" \n [7] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW36860.jpg\"  \n [8] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW389387.jpg\" \n [9] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW395530.jpg\" \n[10] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW39618.jpg\"  \n[11] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW402973.jpg\" \n[12] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW403188.jpg\" \n[13] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW404127.jpg\" \n[14] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW446243.jpg\" \n[15] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW461895.jpg\" \n[16] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW570557.jpg\" \n[17] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW650052.jpg\" \n[18] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW676197.jpg\" \n[19] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW687458.jpg\" \n[20] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW702035.jpg\" \n[21] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW739455.jpg\" \n[22] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW776212.jpg\" \n[23] \"herbarium/tiny_images/NSW777249.jpg\" \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe output here is a character vector containing names for the created files.

I could make the tiny images public and then display them in this post. The National Herbarium data is released under a Creative Commons By-Attribution licence, so I'm allowed to use the images that way as long as I properly acknowledge the source... which I think is fairly well covered in this post already!\n\nThe task I'm going to set for myself later in this post is to do exactly that, and use tools from the **aws.s3** package to do everything in R. However, I can't do any of that unless I have an AWS account of my very own. The time has come for me to do that.\n\n### Creating the account\n\nSigning up for the account turns out to be pretty easy. All I had to do was visit https://aws.amazon.com/s3/ and click on the \"Create an AWS Account\" button shown in the image below:\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](screenshots/aws_s3_signup.png){width=1221}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\nThis then led me through a pretty standard sign up process. I had to provide an email address for the \"root user\" (i.e., me!), specify a password, and so on. I didn't sign up for anything that cost money. The free tier allows you 5GB of storage for 12 months, which is fairly convenient for \"playing around\" purposes, and that's all I'm intending to do here.  \n\n### Creating credentials\n\nThe next step is to create an access key, so that R can interact with S3 using my credentials. At this point a little care is needed. It is possible to create access credentials for the root user, but that's not a good idea. The root user has access to every AWS service, not just S3, and it's a bad idea to give R access to any credentials that have those permissions. What I'll do here is create an  an \"IAM user\" -- where \"IAM\" stands for \"Identity and Access Management\" -- that *only* has access to my S3 storage, and the credentials I supply to R will be associated with that user. Here's how I did that. First, I went over to the IAM console here: \n\nhttps://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home#/users\n\nOn this screen there's an \"add users\" button that I dutifully click...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](screenshots/s3_iam_add_user_1.png){width=1451}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\nFrom here it's mostly a matter of following prompts. The screenshot below shows me part way through the creation process. The IAM user has its own username, and it will be allowed programmatic access using an access key:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](screenshots/s3_iam_add_user_2.png){width=1115}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\nWhen I get to the next screen it asks me to set the permissions associated with this user. I click on \"attach existing policies directly\", and then type \"S3\" into the search box. It comes up with a list of permission policies associated with S3 and I select the one I want:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](screenshots/s3_iam_add_user_3.png){width=1055}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\nThe third screen is boring. It asks for tags. I don't give it any. I move onto the fourth screen, which turns out to be a review screen:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](screenshots/s3_iam_add_user_4.png){width=1087}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\nHaving decided I am happy with these settings, I click on the \"next\" button that isn't actually shown in these screenshots (it's at the bottom of the page) and it takes me to a final screen that gives me the access key ID and the secret access key:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](screenshots/s3_iam_add_user_5.png){width=1054}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese are the two pieces of information I need to let R access to my S3 storage.\n\n### Storing your AWS credentials in R\n\nThere are several ways of storing these credentials in R. The easiest is to add the credentials to your `.Renviron` file, which you can conveniently open with the `edit_r_environ()` function from the **usethis** package. To get access to the account, the following lines need to be added to your `.Renviron` file:\n\n```\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your access key id>\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your secret key>\n```\n\nHowever, if you're going to be using the same AWS region all the time (e.g., you're in Sydney so you tend to use `\"ap-southeast-2\"` rather than `\"us-east-1\"`), you might as well add a third line that sets your default region. That way, you won't need to bother manually specifying the `region` argument every time you want to interact with S3: the **aws.s3** package will use your default. So for me, the relevant lines ended up looking like this:\n\n```\nAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<my access key id>\nAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<my secret key>\nAWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-southeast-2\n```\n\nAfter restarting R, these new settings will apply.\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://tiny-herbs.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/NSW650052.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n## Manipulating your S3 storage from R\n\nNow that I have an AWS account and credentials, I can start using the **aws.s3** package for more than just downloading files. I can create my own buckets, put objects into those buckets, control the access settings for those objects, and a good deal more besides. So let's give that a go, shall we?\n\n### Creating a new bucket\n\nThe function to create a new bucket is called `put_bucket()` and now that my credentials are set up it's almost comically easy to use. If I want to create a bucket called `\"tiny-herbs\"`, this is what I do:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nput_bucket(\"tiny-herbs\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat seems too easy? I am skeptical. I'm convinced that something must have gone wrong, so my first impulse is to use `bucket_exists()` to verify that it worked. Okay, so... does this new bucket exist?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbucket_exists(\"s3://tiny-herbs/\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\nattr(,\"x-amz-id-2\")\n[1] \"4B8L2PauxADAbOSyFra5ra/OHwObxniV89yWTPe44PJ0TRjIOdsNQdHl1El1t0/39aSQOyJS1FE=\"\nattr(,\"x-amz-request-id\")\n[1] \"GH35D6V4G9W945BY\"\nattr(,\"date\")\n[1] \"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 03:05:15 GMT\"\nattr(,\"x-amz-bucket-region\")\n[1] \"ap-southeast-2\"\nattr(,\"x-amz-access-point-alias\")\n[1] \"false\"\nattr(,\"content-type\")\n[1] \"application/xml\"\nattr(,\"server\")\n[1] \"AmazonS3\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt does, and notice that both `put_bucket()` and `bucket_exists()` have respected my default region setting. When I called `put_bucket()`, the **aws.s3** package supplied the region from my default and so the bucket was created in Sydney (i.e., \"ap-southeast-2\"), and it did the same again when I used `bucket_exists()` to look for the buckets.\n\nSo what's in the bucket? Just like I did with the National Herbarium bucket, I can use the `get_bucket_df()` function to inspect the contents of my bucket:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_bucket_df(\"s3://tiny-herbs/\") %>% \n  as_tibble()\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 0 × 8\n# … with 8 variables: Key <chr>, LastModified <chr>, ETag <chr>, Size <chr>,\n#   Owner_ID <chr>, Owner_DisplayName <chr>, StorageClass <chr>, Bucket <chr>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHm. Well, yes. Of course it's empty: I haven't put any objects in it yet. Maybe I should do that? It does seem like a good idea!\n\nBut first...\n\n### Managing access control\n\nOne thing though... is this private or public? This is governed by the Access Control List (ACL) settings. By default, S3 buckets are set to private. You can read and write to them, but no-one else has any access at all. Let's soften that slightly, and allow anyone to read from the \"tiny-herbs\" bucket. I could have done that from the beginning by setting `acl = \"public-read\"` when I called `put_bucket()`. However, because I \"forgot\" to do that earlier, I'll change it now using `put_acl()`\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-29_1fd59396c2d351c8fdf4633241ef6b52'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nput_acl(\n  bucket = \"s3://tiny-herbs/\",\n  acl = \"public-read\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow everyone has read access to the bucket.^[You can specify different ACL settings for each object, if you want to. The `put_acl()` function also has an `object` argument that allows you to control the setting for a single object in a bucket.]\n\n### Adding objects to your bucket\n\nTo put an object inside my new bucket, the function I need is `put_object()`. When calling it, I need to specify the local path to the `file` that I want to upload, the name that the `object` will be assigned when it is added to the bucket, and of course the `bucket` itself. This time around, I'll also explicitly set `acl = \"public-read\"` to ensure that -- while only I have write access -- everyone has read access and can download the object if they want to. Because I'm going to call this repeatedly, I'll wrap all this in a helper function called `put_tiny_image()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nput_tiny_image <- function(file) {\n  put_object(\n    file = file.path(\"herbarium\", \"tiny_images\", file),\n    object = file, \n    bucket = \"s3://tiny-herbs/\",\n    acl = \"public-read\"\n  )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo see this in action, let's create a vector that lists the names of all the tiny images, and then apply the `put_tiny_image()` function to the first one:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntiny_images <- list.files(\"herbarium/tiny_images\")\ntiny_images[1] %>% \n  put_tiny_image()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOkay that seems to work, so once again I'll use **purrr** to iterate over all the `tiny_images`, uploading them one by one into my newly-created bucket:\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='index_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-32_091b93ac8aa084d7681aa0638904c615'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntiny_images %>% \n  map_lgl(put_tiny_image)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n[16] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat looks pretty good! I'm seeing nothing but `TRUE` values in the output so it looks like I've successfully uploaded all the tiny images. Now that I've done this, I can try calling `get_bucket_df()` again to inspect the current contents of the bucket:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nget_bucket_df(\"s3://tiny-herbs/\") %>% \n  as_tibble()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 23 × 8\n   Key            LastModified        ETag  Size  Owner…¹ Owner…² Stora…³ Bucket\n   <chr>          <chr>               <chr> <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>   <chr> \n 1 NSW1055313.jpg 2022-08-23T03:05:1… \"\\\"c… 1494… b8b231… djnava… STANDA… tiny-…\n 2 NSW121207.jpg  2022-04-22T09:08:0… \"\\\"6… 1562… b8b231… djnava… STANDA… tiny-…\n 3 NSW214616.jpg  2022-04-22T09:08:0… \"\\\"f… 2041… b8b231… djnava… STANDA… tiny-…\n 4 NSW29246.jpg   2022-04-22T09:08:0… \"\\\"e… 1043… b8b231… djnava… STANDA… tiny-…\n 5 NSW306564.jpg  2022-04-22T09:08:0… \"\\\"d… 1819… b8b231… djnava… STANDA… tiny-…\n 6 NSW307215.jpg  2022-04-22T09:08:0… \"\\\"e… 1684… b8b231… djnava… STANDA… tiny-…\n 7 NSW36860.jpg   2022-04-22T09:08:1… \"\\\"f… 1962… b8b231… djnava… STANDA… tiny-…\n 8 NSW389387.jpg  2022-04-22T09:08:1… \"\\\"d… 1240… b8b231… djnava… STANDA… tiny-…\n 9 NSW395530.jpg  2022-04-22T09:08:1… \"\\\"3… 1435… b8b231… djnava… STANDA… tiny-…\n10 NSW39618.jpg   2022-04-22T09:08:1… \"\\\"a… 1028… b8b231… djnava… STANDA… tiny-…\n# … with 13 more rows, and abbreviated variable names ¹​Owner_ID,\n#   ²​Owner_DisplayName, ³​StorageClass\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYay! It's done!\n\n### URLs for objects in public buckets\n\nOne last thing. Because the `\"tiny-herbs\"` bucket is public, the objects it contains each have their own URL. To make my life a little easier, I wrote a helper function that constructs these URL:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntiny_herb_url <- function(object, \n                          bucket = \"tiny-herbs\",\n                          region = \"ap-southeast-2\") {\n  paste0(\n    \"https://\", bucket, \".\", \"s3-\", \n    region, \".amazonaws.com\", \"/\", object\n  )\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor example, here's one of the URLs associated with the `\"tiny-herbs\"` bucket:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntiny_herb_url(\"NSW121207.jpg\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"https://tiny-herbs.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/NSW121207.jpg\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe images I've been showing throughout this post aren't the original ones from the National Herbarium data set. Rather, they're the smaller files I stored in the `\"tiny-herbs\"` bucket, and the code I've been using to display the images throughout the post looks like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntiny_herb_url(\"NSW121207.jpg\") %>% \n  knitr::include_graphics()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](https://tiny-herbs.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/NSW121207.jpg)\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n## Wrapping up\n\nAt the end of all this you might have all kinds of questions. Questions like, \"Danielle, what's wrong with you?\" and \"Danielle, is this even your job? Aren't you supposed to be working on Apache Arrow?\" While I could write an entire novel trying to answer the first one, I think I'll skip over it and move straight onto the second on, because that's more interesting and doesn't require anyone to get a therapist. \n\nAlthough this isn't a post about Apache Arrow -- and so is not directly related to the work I do every day -- of the reasons I found myself looking into S3 in the first place is that Arrow is a tool designed to let data scientists work with very large data sets, and S3 is a tool designed to make it easy to store very large data sets. These two things go well together, so much so that the **arrow** R package has its own support for S3 data storage, and many of the data sets that new **arrow** users encounter are stored on S3. From an educational perspective (sorry -- I used to be an academic and I can't help myself) it's really difficult for people when they need to learn lots of things at the same time. Trying to learn how Arrow works is really hard when you're still confused about S3. When I started learning Arrow I didn't know anything about S3, and it was extremely frustrating to have to learn Arrow concepts with all this confusing S3 stuff floating around. \n\nHence... this post. My main goal here was to talk about S3 as a topic in its own right, and how tools like **aws.s3** allow R users to write code that interacts with S3 data storage. But it's very handy background knowledge to have if you're planning to use **arrow** later on. \n\nOn top of all that, the **aws.s3** package has a lot more functionality that I haven't talked about here. You can use it to copy objects from one bucket to another, and delete objects and buckets that you control. You can use it to add tagging metadata, you can use it to configure your S3 bucket as a website (yes, even with all that painful cross-origin resource sharing configuration stuff), and a good deal more besides. It's a really nice package and I'm glad I took the time to learn it!\n\n<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
