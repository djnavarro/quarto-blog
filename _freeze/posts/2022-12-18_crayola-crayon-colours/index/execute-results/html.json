If you're looking to analyse a Dataset using R, you don't really need to know much of this. Frankly you probably don't need to know any of it. But also there's something uncomfortable about using tools when you don't quite know what they're doing. It makes me happier when I know just a little bit more than I actually need to know. More importantly, it matters in the sense that it *works*. Using Datasets leads to shockingly fast performance on data that would not normally be amenable to analysis with R. Which... yeah, that does matter quite a bit!\n\n<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->\n\n\n",
