So I wrote a simple package for [multi-threaded tasks queues in R](https://queue.djnavarro.net) this week. It wasn't intentional, I swear. I was just trying to teach myself how to use the [callr](https://callr.r-lib.org/) package, and making sure I had a solid grasp of encapsulated object-oriented programming with [R6](https://r6.r-lib.org/). Things got a little out of hand. Sorry.\n\nAnd let's be very clear about something at the outset. If you want to do parallel computing in R correctly, you go look at [futureverse.org](https://www.futureverse.org/). The [future](https://future.futureverse.org/) package provides a fabulous way to execute R code asynchronously and in parallel. And there are many excellent packages built on top of that, so there's a whole lovely ecosystem there just waiting for you.^[Note to self: Learn [parallelly](https://www.jottr.org/2022/12/05/avoid-detectcores/)] Relatedly, if the reason you're thinking about parallel computing is that you've found yourself with a burning need to analyze terabytes of data with R then babe it might be time to start learning some R workflows using [Spark](https://therinspark.com/), [Arrow](https://blog.djnavarro.net/category/apachearrow), [Kubernetes](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/04/wtf-is-kubernetes-and-should-i-care-as-r-user/). It may be time to learn about some of those other eldritch words of power that have figured rather more prominently in my life than one might expect for a simple country girl.^[`kubectl auth can-i create occult-chaos`] \n\nMy little queue package is a personal project. I happen to like it, but you should not be looking at it as an alternative to serious tools.\n\nThat's been said now. Good. We can put aside all pretension.\n\n## First time callr\n\n- https://callr.r-lib.org/\n- https://processx.r-lib.org/\n\n\n<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->\n\n\n",
