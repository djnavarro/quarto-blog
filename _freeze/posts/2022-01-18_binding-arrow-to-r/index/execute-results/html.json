It was very modest contribution: I wrote some code that determines whether any given year is a leap year. It precisely mirrors the behaviour of the `leap_year()` function in the **lubridate** package, except that it can be applied to Arrow data and it will behave itself when used in the context of a **dplyr** pipeline (more on that later). The code itself is not complicated, but it relies on a little magic and a deeper understanding of Arrow than I possessed two weeks ago.  \n\n:::{.column-margin}\nThroughout this post I'll use boldface to refer to specific R packages like **dplyr** or C++ libraries like **libarrow**\n:::\n\nThis post is the story of how I learned Arrow magic. ‚ú® üèπ ‚ú®   \n\n\n\n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->\n## Why am I writing this?\n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->\n\n\n> The danger of sublimated trauma is a major theme in our story <br>\n> &nbsp; &nbsp; -- The Great God Ember (The Magicians: Season 2, Episode 3)\n\nIt might seem peculiar that I'm writing such a long post about such a tiny contribution to an open source project. After all, it doesn't actually take a lot of work to figure out how to detect leap years. You can do it in one line of R code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(year %% 4 == 0) & ((year %% 100 != 0) | (year %% 400 == 0))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis is a logical expression corresponding to the following rules. If the `year` is divisible by 4 then it is a leap year (e.g., 1996 was a leap year). But there's an exception: if `year` is divisible by 100 then it isn't a leap year (e.g., 1900 wasn't a leap year). But there's also an exception to the exception: if `year` is divisible by 400 then it is a leap year (e.g., 2000 was a leap year). Yes, the process of mapping the verbally stated rules onto a logical expression is kind of annoying, but it's not conceptually difficult or unusual. There is no magic in leap year calculation, no mystery that needs unpacking and explaining.\n\n:::{.column-margin}\nAll this assumes years are counted using the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar). There are, of course, [other calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_calendars)\n:::\n\nThe magic comes in when you start thinking about what the **arrow** package actually does. It lets you write perfectly ordinary R code for data manipulation that returns perfectly ordinary R data structures, even though the data have never been loaded into R and all the computation is performed externally using Apache Arrow. The code you write with **arrow** looks and feels like regular R code, but almost none of the work is being done by R. This *is* deep magic, and it is this magic that needs to be demystified.\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Two key moments in \"The Magicians\" when Julia Wicker discovers she can do magic, defying the expectations of others. One moment occurs at the start of Season 1 as a novice, after she had been told she failed the magic exams at Brakebills University; another moment occurs at the end of Season 2 after all magic has supposedly been turned off by the Old Gods or something. The parallel between the two moments is striking. Oh and Quentin Coldwater is in both scenes too I guess.

The moment I learn a new thing my first impulse is to work out how to explain it to someone else. \n- The second reasons is professional: I work for Voltron Data now, and part of my job is to make an educational contribution to the open source Apache Arrow project. Arrow is a pretty cool project, but there's very little value in magnificent software if you don't help people learn how to take advantage of it! \n- The third reason is ethical: a readable tutorial/explanation lowers barriers to entry. I mean, let's be honest: the only reason I was able to work up the courage to contribute to Apache Arrow is that I work for a company that is deeply invested in open source software and in the Arrow project specifically. I had colleagues and friends I could ask for advice. If I failed I knew they would be there to help me. I had a safety net. \n\nThe last of these is huuuuuuugely important from a community point of view. Not everyone has the safety net that I have, and it makes a big difference. In a former life I've been on the other side of this divide: I've been the person with no support, nobody to ask for help, and I've run afoul of capricious gatekeeping in the open source world. It is a deeply unpleasant experience, and one I would not wish upon anyone else. We lose good people when this happens, and I really don't want that! \n\nThe quote from the beginning of this section, the one about the danger of sublimated trauma, is relevant here: if we want healthy user communities it is our *obligation* on the inside to provide safe environments and delightful experiences. Our job is to find and remove barriers to entry. We want to provide that \"safety net\" that ensures that even if you fall (because we all fall sometimes), you don't get hurt. Failing safely at something can be a learning experience; suffering trauma, however, is almost never healthy. So yeah, this matters to me. I want to take what I've learned now that I'm on the inside and make that knowledge more widely accessible. \n\n:::{.column-margin}\nEveryone deserves a [safety net](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/code_hero_rstats.png) when first learning to walk the tightropes.

If you need a refresher on these topics, I cannot recommend [\"R for data science\"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) highly enough. It's a fabulous resource! \n- On the Arrow side it would help a little if you have some vague idea of what Arrow is about. I will of course explain as I go, but if you're looking for a post that starts at the very beginning, I wrote a post on [\"Getting started with Apache Arrow\"](https://blog.djnavarro.net/starting-apache-arrow-in-r) that does exactly this and discusses a lot of the basics. \n- Finally, a tiny R warning: later in the post I will do a little excursion into object oriented programming and metaprogramming in R, which will be familiar to some but not all readers. If you're not comfortable with these topics, you should still be okay to skim those sections and still get the important parts of this post.

Apache Arrow is a standard and open source library that represents tabular data efficiently in memory. More generally it refers to a collection of tools used to work with Arrow data. There are libraries supporting Arrow in many different programming languages, including C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, Julia, MATLAB, Python, R, Ruby, and Rust. It's pretty cool. \n\n\n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->\n## Using Arrow in R\n<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->\n\n\nA fundamental thing to understand about the **arrow** package in R is that it doesn't implement the Apache Arrow standard directly. In fact, it tries very hard not to do any of the heavy lifting itself. There's a C++ library that does that in a super efficient way, and the job of the R package is to supply bindings that allow the R user to interact with that library using a familiar interface. The C++ library is called **libarrow**. Although the long term goal is to make the integration so seamless that you can use the **arrow** R package without ever *needing* to understand the C++ library, my experience has been that most people *want* to know something about what's happening under the hood. It can be unsettling to find yourself programming with tools you don't quite understand, so I'll dig a little deeper in this post.\n\nLet's start with the C++ library. The role of **libarrow** is to do all the heavy computational work. It implements all the Arrow standards for representing tabular data in memory, provides support for the Apache \"Inter-Process Communication\" (IPC) protocol that lets you efficiently transfer data from one application to another, and supplies various *compute kernels* that allow you to do some data wrangling when your data are represented as an Arrow table.^[I didn't quite understand what \"kernels\" meant in this context until Nic Crane kindly explained it to me. The compute API contains a number of functions which are divided up into \"kernels\", specialised functions designed to work on a specific data type. The [C++ Arrow compute documentation](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/compute.html) explains this better.] It is, fundamentally, the engine that makes everything work.\n\nWhat about the R package? The role of **arrow** is to expose the functionality of **libarrow** to the R user, to make that functionality feel \"natural\" in R, and to make it easier for R users to write Arrow code that is smoothly interoperable with Arrow code written in other languages (e.g., Python). In order to give you the flexibility you need, the **arrow** package allows you to interact with **libarrow** at three different levels of abstraction:\n\n- There's a heavily abstracted interface that uses [the dplyr bindings supplied by arrow](#using-dplyr-bindings). This version strives to make **libarrow** almost completely invisible, hidden behind an interface that uses familiar R function names.\n- There's a lightly abstracted interface you can access [using the `arrow_*()` functions](#using-arrow-functions). This version exposes the **libarrow** functions without attempting to exactly mirror any particular R functions, and provides a little [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) to make your life easier.\n- Finally, there's a minimally abstracted interface [using `call_function()`](#using-call-function). This version provides a bare bones interface, without any of the syntactic sugar.\n\nOver the next few sections section I'll talk about these three levels of abstraction. So let's load the packages we're going to need for this post and dive right in!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(arrow)\n```\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Penny Adiyodi in the Neitherlands, diving head first into a fountain that transports him to a new and magical world.

Here's a little recap of how that works, using a tiny data set I pulled from [The Magicians Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Magicians_(American_TV_series)_episodes#Season_1_(2015%E2%80%9316)). Here's what that data set looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmagicians <- read_csv_arrow(\"magicians.csv\", as_data_frame = TRUE)\nmagicians\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 65 √ó 6\n   season episode title                                air_date   rating viewers\n    <int>   <int> <chr>                                <date>      <dbl>   <dbl>\n 1      1       1 Unauthorized Magic                   2015-12-16    0.2    0.92\n 2      1       2 The Source of Magic                  2016-01-25    0.4    1.11\n 3      1       3 Consequences of Advanced Spellcasti‚Ä¶ 2016-02-01    0.4    0.9 \n 4      1       4 The World in the Walls               2016-02-08    0.3    0.75\n 5      1       5 Mendings, Major and Minor            2016-02-15    0.3    0.75\n 6      1       6 Impractical Applications             2016-02-22    0.3    0.65\n 7      1       7 The Mayakovsky Circumstance          2016-02-29    0.3    0.7 \n 8      1       8 The Strangled Heart                  2016-03-07    0.3    0.67\n 9      1       9 The Writing Room                     2016-03-14    0.3    0.71\n10      1      10 Homecoming                           2016-03-21    0.3    0.78\n# ‚Ñπ 55 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the code above I used the `read_csv_arrow()` function from the **arrow** package. If you've used the `read_csv()` function from **readr** this will seem very familiar: although Arrow C++ code is doing a lot of the work under the hood, the Arrow options have been chosen to mirror the familiar **readr** interface. The `as_data_frame` argument is specific to **arrow** though: when it is `TRUE` the data are imported into R as a data frame or tibble, and when it is `FALSE` the data are imported into Arrow. Strictly speaking I didn't need to specify it in this example because `TRUE` is the default value. I ony included here so that I could draw attention to it. \n\nOkay, now that we have the data let's start with a fairly typical data analysis process: computing summary variables. Perhaps I want to know the average popularity and ratings for each season of *The Magicians*, and extract the year in which the season aired. The **dplyr** package provides me with the tools I need to do this, using functions like `mutate()` to create new variables, `group_by()` to specify grouping variables, and `summarise()` to aggregate data within group:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmagicians %>% \n  mutate(year = year(air_date)) %>% \n  group_by(season) %>% \n  summarise(\n    viewers = mean(viewers),\n    rating = mean(rating), \n    year = max(year)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 4\n  season viewers rating  year\n   <int>   <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>\n1      1   0.776  0.308  2016\n2      2   0.788  0.323  2017\n3      3   0.696  0.269  2018\n4      4   0.541  0.2    2019\n5      5   0.353  0.111  2020\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAll of these computations take place within R. The `magicians` data set is stored in R, and all the calculations are done using this data structure. \n\nWhat can we do when the data are stored in Arrow? It turns out the code is almost identical, but the first thing  I'll need to do is load the data into Arrow. The simplest way to do this is to set `as_data_frame = FALSE` when calling `arrow_read_csv()` \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrowmagicks <- read_csv_arrow(\"magicians.csv\", as_data_frame = FALSE)\narrowmagicks\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTable\n65 rows x 6 columns\n$season <int64>\n$episode <int64>\n$title <string>\n$air_date <date32[day]>\n$rating <double>\n$viewers <double>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.column-margin}\nThe \"arrowmagicks\" variable name is a reference to the quote at the start of the section. For a while Josh was convinced he had been gifted with special magic because he had been a fish. It made sense at the time, I guess? It's a weird show\n:::\n\nWhen I do this, two things happen. First, a data set is created outside of R in memory allocated to Arrow: all of the computations will be done on that data set. Second, the `arrowmagicks` variable is created inside R, which consists of a pointer to the actual data along with some handy metadata. \n\nThe most natural way to work with this data in R is to make sure that both the **arrow** and **dplyr** packages are loaded, and then write regular **dplyr** code. You can do this because the **arrow** package supplies methods for **dplyr** functions, and these methods will be called whenever the input data is an Arrow Table. I'll refer to this data analyses that use this workflow as \"arrowplyr pipelines\". Here's an example of an arrowplyr pipeline:\n\n:::{.column-margin}\nI've chosen not to boldface the \"arrowplyr\" terminology. **arrow** is a package and **dplyr** is a package, but arrowplyr isn't. It's simply a convenient fiction\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrowmagicks %>% \n  mutate(year = year(air_date)) %>% \n  group_by(season) %>% \n  summarise(\n    viewers = mean(viewers),\n    rating = mean(rating), \n    year = max(year)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTable (query)\nseason: int64\nviewers: double\nrating: double\nyear: int64\n\nSee $.data for the source Arrow object\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like a regular **dplyr** pipeline, but because the input is `arrowmagicks` (an Arrow Table object), the effect of this is construct a query that can be passed to **libarrow** to be evaluated. \n\nIt's important to realise that at this point, all we have done is define a query: no computations have been performed on the Arrow data. This is a deliberate choice for efficiency purposes: on the C++ side there are a lot of performance optimisations that are only possible because **libarrow** has access to the entire query before any computations are performed. As a consequence of this, you need to explicitly tell Arrow when you want to pull the trigger and execute the query. \n\n:::{.column-margin}\nLater in the post I'll talk about Arrow Expressions, the tool that powers this trickery\n:::\n\nThere are two ways to trigger query execution, one using the `compute()` function and the other using `collect()`. These two functions behave slightly differently and are useful for different purposes. The `compute()` function runs the query, but leaves the resulting data inside Arrow:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrowmagicks %>% \n  mutate(year = year(air_date)) %>% \n  group_by(season) %>% \n  summarise(\n    viewers = mean(viewers),\n    rating = mean(rating), \n    year = max(year)\n  ) %>% \n  compute()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTable\n5 rows x 4 columns\n$season <int64>\n$viewers <double>\n$rating <double>\n$year <int64>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is useful whenever you're creating an intermediate data set that you want to reuse in Arrow later, but don't need to use this intermediate data structure inside R. If, however, you want the output to be pulled into R so that you can do R computation with it, use the `collect()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrowmagicks %>% \n  mutate(year = year(air_date)) %>% \n  group_by(season) %>% \n  summarise(\n    viewers = mean(viewers),\n    rating = mean(rating), \n    year = max(year)\n  ) %>% \n  collect()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 √ó 4\n  season viewers rating  year\n   <int>   <dbl>  <dbl> <int>\n1      1   0.776  0.308  2016\n2      2   0.788  0.323  2017\n3      3   0.696  0.269  2018\n4      4   0.541  0.2    2019\n5      5   0.353  0.111  2020\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe nice thing for R users is that all of this feels like regular R code. Under the hood **libarrow** is doing all the serious computation, but at the R level the user really doesn't need to worry too much about that. The arrowplyr toolkit works seamlessly and invisibly.\n\nIn our ideal world, the arrowplyr interface is all you would ever need to use. Internally, the **arrow** package would intercept all the R function calls you make, and replace them with an equivalent function that performs exactly the same computation using **libarrow**. You the user would never need to think about what's happening under the hood.\n\nReal life, however, is filled with [leaky abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/), and arrowplyr is no exception. Because it's a huge project that is under active development, there's a lot of functionality being introduced. As an example, the current version of the package (v6.0.1) has limited support for tidyverse packages like **lubridate** and **stringr**. It's awesome that this functionality is coming online, but because it's happening so quickly there are gaps. The small contribution that I made today was to fill one of those gaps: currently, you can't refer to the `leap_year()` function from **lubridate** in an arrowplyr pipeline. Well, technically you can, but whenever **arrow** encounters a function it doesn't know how to execute in Arrow it throws a warning, pulls the data into R, and completes the query using native R code. Here's what that looks like:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrowmagicks %>% \n  mutate(\n    year = year(air_date), \n    leap = leap_year(air_date)\n  ) %>% \n  collect()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 65 √ó 8\n   season episode title                    air_date   rating viewers  year leap \n    <int>   <int> <chr>                    <date>      <dbl>   <dbl> <int> <lgl>\n 1      1       1 Unauthorized Magic       2015-12-16    0.2    0.92  2015 FALSE\n 2      1       2 The Source of Magic      2016-01-25    0.4    1.11  2016 TRUE \n 3      1       3 Consequences of Advance‚Ä¶ 2016-02-01    0.4    0.9   2016 TRUE \n 4      1       4 The World in the Walls   2016-02-08    0.3    0.75  2016 TRUE \n 5      1       5 Mendings, Major and Min‚Ä¶ 2016-02-15    0.3    0.75  2016 TRUE \n 6      1       6 Impractical Applications 2016-02-22    0.3    0.65  2016 TRUE \n 7      1       7 The Mayakovsky Circumst‚Ä¶ 2016-02-29    0.3    0.7   2016 TRUE \n 8      1       8 The Strangled Heart      2016-03-07    0.3    0.67  2016 TRUE \n 9      1       9 The Writing Room         2016-03-14    0.3    0.71  2016 TRUE \n10      1      10 Homecoming               2016-03-21    0.3    0.78  2016 TRUE \n# ‚Ñπ 55 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.column-margin}\nThis is a bit of an oversimplification.

Realising that it doesn't know how to interpret `leap_year()`, the **arrow** package has tried to \"fail gracefully\" and pulled everything back into R. The end result of all this is that the code executes as a regular **dplyr** pipeline and not as an arrowplyr one.

These are designed to mimic their native R equivalents as seamlessly as possible to enable you to write familiar code. Internally, there's quite a lot going on to make this magic work. In most cases, the **arrow** developers -- which I guess includes me now! üéâ -- have rewritten the R functions that they mimic. We've done this in a way that the computations rely only the C++ compute functions provided by **libarrow**, thereby ensuring that the data never have to enter R. The arrowplyr interface is the way you'd usually interact with Arrow in R, but there are ways in which you can access the C++ compute functions a little more more directly. There are two different ways you can call these compute functions yourself. If you're working within an arrowplyr pipeline it is (relatively!) straightforward, and that's what I'll talk about in this section. However, there is also a more direct method which I'll discuss later in the post.\n\nTo see what compute functions are exposed by the C++ **libarrow** library, you can call `list_compute_functions()` from R:\n\n\n::: {.cell out.lines='10'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlist_compute_functions()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  [1] \"abs\"                             \"abs_checked\"                    \n  [3] \"acos\"                            \"acos_checked\"                   \n  [5] \"add\"                             \"add_checked\"                    \n  [7] \"all\"                             \"and\"                            \n  [9] \"and_kleene\"                      \"and_not\"                        \n [11] \"and_not_kleene\"                  \"any\"                            \n [13] \"approximate_median\"              \"array_filter\"                   \n [15] \"array_sort_indices\"              \"array_take\"                     \n [17] \"ascii_capitalize\"                \"ascii_center\"                   \n [19] \"ascii_is_alnum\"                  \"ascii_is_alpha\"                 \n....\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe actual output continues for quite a while: there are currently 251 compute functions, most of which are low level functions needed to perform basic computational operations. \n\n\nLet's imagine you're writing **dplyr** code to work with datetime data in a Table object like `arrowmagicks`. If you were working with native R data like `magicians`, you can do something like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstart_date <- as.Date(\"2015-12-16\")\n\nmagicians %>% \n  mutate(days = air_date - start_date)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 65 √ó 7\n   season episode title                          air_date   rating viewers days \n    <int>   <int> <chr>                          <date>      <dbl>   <dbl> <drt>\n 1      1       1 Unauthorized Magic             2015-12-16    0.2    0.92  0 d‚Ä¶\n 2      1       2 The Source of Magic            2016-01-25    0.4    1.11 40 d‚Ä¶\n 3      1       3 Consequences of Advanced Spel‚Ä¶ 2016-02-01    0.4    0.9  47 d‚Ä¶\n 4      1       4 The World in the Walls         2016-02-08    0.3    0.75 54 d‚Ä¶\n 5      1       5 Mendings, Major and Minor      2016-02-15    0.3    0.75 61 d‚Ä¶\n 6      1       6 Impractical Applications       2016-02-22    0.3    0.65 68 d‚Ä¶\n 7      1       7 The Mayakovsky Circumstance    2016-02-29    0.3    0.7  75 d‚Ä¶\n 8      1       8 The Strangled Heart            2016-03-07    0.3    0.67 82 d‚Ä¶\n 9      1       9 The Writing Room               2016-03-14    0.3    0.71 89 d‚Ä¶\n10      1      10 Homecoming                     2016-03-21    0.3    0.78 96 d‚Ä¶\n# ‚Ñπ 55 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere I've created a new `days` column that counts the number of days that have elapsed between the `air_date` for an episode and the `start_date` (December 16th, 2015) when the first episode of Season 1 aired.

However, because I chose this example rather carefully to find an edge case where the R package is missing some **libarrow** functionality, it turns out there is actually a `days_between()` function in **libarrow** that we could use to solve this problem, and it's not too hard to use it. If you want to call one of the **libarrow** functions inside your **dplyr** pipeline, all you have to do is add an `arrow_` prefix to the function name. For example, the C++ `days_between()` function becomes `arrow_days_between()` when called within the **arrow** **dplyr** pipeline:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrowmagicks %>% \n  mutate(days = arrow_days_between(start_date, air_date)) %>% \n  collect()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 65 √ó 7\n   season episode title                          air_date   rating viewers  days\n    <int>   <int> <chr>                          <date>      <dbl>   <dbl> <int>\n 1      1       1 Unauthorized Magic             2015-12-16    0.2    0.92     0\n 2      1       2 The Source of Magic            2016-01-25    0.4    1.11    40\n 3      1       3 Consequences of Advanced Spel‚Ä¶ 2016-02-01    0.4    0.9     47\n 4      1       4 The World in the Walls         2016-02-08    0.3    0.75    54\n 5      1       5 Mendings, Major and Minor      2016-02-15    0.3    0.75    61\n 6      1       6 Impractical Applications       2016-02-22    0.3    0.65    68\n 7      1       7 The Mayakovsky Circumstance    2016-02-29    0.3    0.7     75\n 8      1       8 The Strangled Heart            2016-03-07    0.3    0.67    82\n 9      1       9 The Writing Room               2016-03-14    0.3    0.71    89\n10      1      10 Homecoming                     2016-03-21    0.3    0.78    96\n# ‚Ñπ 55 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNotice there's no warning message here?

In the previous section I used the `arrow_days_between()` function in the middle of a **dplyr** pipe to work around a current limitation in **arrow**. What happens if I try to call this function in another context?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntoday <- as.Date(\"2022-01-18\")\n\narrow_days_between(start_date, today)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in arrow_days_between(start_date, today): could not find function \"arrow_days_between\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt turns out there is no R function called `arrow_days_between()`. This is ... surprising, to say the least. I mean, it really does look like I used this function in the last section, doesn't it? How does this work? The answer to this requires a slightly deeper understanding of what the **dplyr** bindings in **arrow** do, and it's kind of a two-part answer.\n\n\n\n### Part one: Object oriented programming \n\nLet's consider the `mutate()` function. **dplyr** defines `mutate()` as an [S3 generic function](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html), which allows it to display \"polymorphism\": it behaves differently depending on what kind of object is passed to the generic. When you pass a data frame to `mutate()`, the call is \"dispatched\" to the `mutate.arrow_dplyr_query()` methods supplied by (but not exported by) **dplyr**. The **arrow** package builds on this by supplying methods that apply for Arrow objects. Specifically, there are internal functions `mutate.ArrowTabular()`, `mutate.Dataset()`, and `mutate.arrow_dplyr_query()` that are used to provide `mutate()` functionality for Arrow data sets. In other words, the \"top level\" **dplyr** functions in **arrow** are S3 methods, and method dispatch is the mechanism that does the work.\n\n\n\n### Part two: Metaprogramming \n\nNow let's consider the `leap_year()` function that my contribution focused on. Not only is this not a generic function, it's not even a **dplyr** function. It's a regular function in the **lubridate** package. So how is it possible for **arrow** to mimic the behaviour of `lubridate::leap_year()` without messing up **lubridate**? This is where the *dplyr* binding part comes in. Let's imagine that I'd written an actual function called `arrowish_leap_year()` that performs leap year calculations for Arrow data. If I'd done this inside the **arrow** package^[My actual code didn't bother to name my function. It's just an anonymous function passed to `register_binding()`.] then I'd include a line like this to register a binding:\n\n:::{.column-margin}\nI'll show you how to write your own [\"arrowish\" functions](#arrowish-functions) later in the post\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nregister_binding(\"leap_year\", arrowish_leap_year)\n```\n:::\n\n\nOnce the binding has been registered, whenever `leap_year()` is encountered within one of the **arrow**-supplied **dplyr** functions, R will substitute my `arrowish_leap_year()` function in place of the `lubridate::leap_year()` function that would normally be called. This is only possible because R has extremely sophisticated [metaprogramming](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/metaprogramming.html) tools: you (the developer) can write functions that \"capture\" the code that the user input, and if necessary modify that code before R evaluates it. This is a very powerful tool for constructing domain-specific languages within R. The tidyverse uses it extensively, and the **arrow** package does too. The **dplyr** bindings inside **arrow** use metaprogramming tricks to modify the user input in such a way that -- in this example -- the user input is interpreted as if the user had called `arrowish_leap_year()` rather than `leap_year()`.\n\n\n\n### Cooperative magic\n\nTaken together, these two pieces give us the answer to our puzzle. The call to `arrow_days_between()` works in my original example because that call was constructed within the context of an **arrow**-supplied `mutate()` function. The interpretation of this code isn't performed by **dplyr** it is handled by **arrow**. Internally, **arrow** uses metaprogramming magic to ensure that `arrow_days_between()` is reinterpreted as a call to the **libarrow** `days_between()` function. But that metaprogramming magic doesn't apply anywhere except the arrowplyr context. If you try to call `arrow_days_between()` from the R console or even in a regular **dplyr** pipeline, you get an error because technically speaking this function doesn't exist. \n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![I guess there's a connection between slightly-evil-Julia burning down the talking trees and my slightly-evil digression?

Given that the \"arrow-prefix\" function don't actually exist in the usual sense of the term, and the corresponding bindings can only be called in an arrowplyr context, how the heck does an R developer call the **libarrow** functions directly? In everyday data analysis you wouldn't want to do this very often, but from a programming perspective it matters: if you want to write your own functions that play nicely with arrowplyr pipelines, it's very handy to know how to call **libarrow** directly.  \n\nSo let's strip back another level of abstraction! \n\nShould you ever find yourself wanting to call **libarrow** compute functions directly from R, `call_function()` will become your new best friend. It provides a very minimal interface that exposes the **libarrow** functions to R. The \"bare bones\" nature of this interface has advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is simplicity: your code doesn't depend on any of the fancy bells and whistles. Those are fabulous from the user perspective, but from a developer point of view you usually want to keep it simple. The price you pay for this is that you must pass appropriate Arrow objects. You can't pass a regular R object to a **libarrow** function and expect it to work. For example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncall_function(\"days_between\", start_date, today)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: Argument 1 is of class Date but it must be one of \"Array\", \"ChunkedArray\", \"RecordBatch\", \"Table\", or \"Scalar\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis doesn't work because `start_date` and `today` are R-native Date objects and do not refer to any data structures in Arrow. The **libarrow** functions expect to receive pointers to Arrow objects. To fix the previous example, all we need to do is create Arrow Scalars for each date. Here's how we do that:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrow_start_date <- Scalar$create(start_date)\narrow_today <- Scalar$create(today)\n\narrow_start_date\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nScalar\n2015-12-16\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `arrow_start_date` and `arrow_today` variables are R data structures, but they're only thin wrappers. The actual data are stored in Arrow, and the R objects are really just pointers to the Arrow data. These objects are suitable for passing to the **libarrow** `days_between()` function, and this works:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncall_function(\"days_between\", arrow_start_date, arrow_today)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nScalar\n2225\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHuh.

When I introduced arrowplyr early in the post I noted that most of your code is used to specify a query, and that query doesn't get evaluated until `compute()` or `collect()` is called. If you want to write code that plays nicely with this workflow, you need to ensure that your custom functions return an Arrow Expression. \n\nThe basic idea behind expressions is probably familiar to R users, since they are what powers the metaprogramming capabilities of the language and are used extensively throughout tidyverse as well as base R. In base R, the `quote()` function is used to capture a user expression and `eval()` is used to force it to evaluate. Here's a simple example where I use `quote()` to \"capture\" some R code and prevent it from evaluating:  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead_expr <- quote(head(magicians, n = 3))\nhead_expr\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nhead(magicians, n = 3)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf I wanted to be clever I could modify the code in `head_expr` before allowing R to pull the trigger on evaluating it. I could combine a lot of expressions together, change parts of the code as needed, and evaluate them wherever I wanted. As you might imagine, this is super useful for creating domain specific languages within R. But this isn't a post about metaprogramming so let's evaluate it now:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neval(head_expr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 √ó 6\n  season episode title                                 air_date   rating viewers\n   <int>   <int> <chr>                                 <date>      <dbl>   <dbl>\n1      1       1 Unauthorized Magic                    2015-12-16    0.2    0.92\n2      1       2 The Source of Magic                   2016-01-25    0.4    1.11\n3      1       3 Consequences of Advanced Spellcasting 2016-02-01    0.4    0.9 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe example above uses native R code. It's not tied to Arrow in any sense. However, the **arrow** package provides a mechanism for doing something similar in an Arrow context. For example, here's me creating a character string as an Arrow Scalar:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfillory <- Scalar$create(\"A world as intricate as filigree\")\nfillory\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nScalar\nA world as intricate as filigree\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere's me creating the corresponding object within an Arrow Expression:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfillory <- Expression$scalar(\n  Scalar$create(\"A world as intricate as filigree\")\n)\nfillory\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nExpression\n\"A world as intricate as filigree\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI suspect this would not seem particularly impressive on its own, but you can use the same idea to create function calls that can be evaluated later within the Arrow context:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nember <- Expression$create(\"utf8_capitalize\", fillory)\nember\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nExpression\nutf8_capitalize(\"A world as intricate as filigree\")\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo close. We are so very close to the end now. \n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Okay look, I'll level with you.

Here's a simple implementation of the base R `toupper()` function\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrowish_toupper <- function(x) {\n  Expression$create(\"utf8_upper\", x)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs it happens arrowplyr pipelines already support the `toupper()` function, so there really wasn't a need for me to write this. However, at present they don't support the **lubridate** `leap_year()` function, which was the purpose of my very small contribution today. An Arrow friendly version of `leap_year()` looks like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrowish_leap_year <- function(date) {\n   year <- Expression$create(\"year\", date)\n  (year %% 4 == 0) & ((year %% 100 != 0) | (year %% 400 == 0))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nBefore putting our functions into action, let's see what happens when we try to write a simple data analysis pipeline without them:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrowmagicks %>% \n  mutate(\n    title = toupper(title),\n    year = year(air_date), \n    leap = leap_year(air_date)\n  ) %>% \n  collect()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 65 √ó 8\n   season episode title                    air_date   rating viewers  year leap \n    <int>   <int> <chr>                    <date>      <dbl>   <dbl> <int> <lgl>\n 1      1       1 UNAUTHORIZED MAGIC       2015-12-16    0.2    0.92  2015 FALSE\n 2      1       2 THE SOURCE OF MAGIC      2016-01-25    0.4    1.11  2016 TRUE \n 3      1       3 CONSEQUENCES OF ADVANCE‚Ä¶ 2016-02-01    0.4    0.9   2016 TRUE \n 4      1       4 THE WORLD IN THE WALLS   2016-02-08    0.3    0.75  2016 TRUE \n 5      1       5 MENDINGS, MAJOR AND MIN‚Ä¶ 2016-02-15    0.3    0.75  2016 TRUE \n 6      1       6 IMPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 2016-02-22    0.3    0.65  2016 TRUE \n 7      1       7 THE MAYAKOVSKY CIRCUMST‚Ä¶ 2016-02-29    0.3    0.7   2016 TRUE \n 8      1       8 THE STRANGLED HEART      2016-03-07    0.3    0.67  2016 TRUE \n 9      1       9 THE WRITING ROOM         2016-03-14    0.3    0.71  2016 TRUE \n10      1      10 HOMECOMING               2016-03-21    0.3    0.78  2016 TRUE \n# ‚Ñπ 55 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.column-margin}\nThe internal **arrow** function that handles this is called \"abandon_ship\". No, I don't know why I felt the need to mention this`\n:::\n\nYes, it returns the correct answer, but only because **arrow** detected a function it doesn't understand and has \"abandoned ship\". It pulled the data into R and let **dplyr** do all the work. Now let's see what happens when we use our functions instead:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\narrowmagicks %>% \n  mutate(\n    title = arrowish_toupper(title),\n    year = year(air_date),\n    leap = arrowish_leap_year(air_date)\n  ) %>% \n  collect()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 65 √ó 8\n   season episode title                    air_date   rating viewers  year leap \n    <int>   <int> <chr>                    <date>      <dbl>   <dbl> <int> <lgl>\n 1      1       1 UNAUTHORIZED MAGIC       2015-12-16    0.2    0.92  2015 FALSE\n 2      1       2 THE SOURCE OF MAGIC      2016-01-25    0.4    1.11  2016 TRUE \n 3      1       3 CONSEQUENCES OF ADVANCE‚Ä¶ 2016-02-01    0.4    0.9   2016 TRUE \n 4      1       4 THE WORLD IN THE WALLS   2016-02-08    0.3    0.75  2016 TRUE \n 5      1       5 MENDINGS, MAJOR AND MIN‚Ä¶ 2016-02-15    0.3    0.75  2016 TRUE \n 6      1       6 IMPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS 2016-02-22    0.3    0.65  2016 TRUE \n 7      1       7 THE MAYAKOVSKY CIRCUMST‚Ä¶ 2016-02-29    0.3    0.7   2016 TRUE \n 8      1       8 THE STRANGLED HEART      2016-03-07    0.3    0.67  2016 TRUE \n 9      1       9 THE WRITING ROOM         2016-03-14    0.3    0.71  2016 TRUE \n10      1      10 HOMECOMING               2016-03-21    0.3    0.78  2016 TRUE \n# ‚Ñπ 55 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEverything works perfectly within Arrow. No ships are abandoned, the arrowplyr pipeline springs no leaks, and we all live happily ever after. \n\nSort of.\n\nI mean, we're all still alive.\n\nThat has to count as a win, right? üéâ\n\n<br>\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Eliot and Margo applaud your success.

I've shown you how to write a function like `arrowish_leap_year()` that can slot into a **dplyr** pipeline and operate on an Arrow data structure. But I haven't said anything about the precise workings of how `register_binding()` works, in part because the details of the metaprogramming magic is one of the mysteries I'm currently unpacking while I dig into the code base. \n\nBut that's not the only thing I've left unsaid. I haven't talked about unit tests, for example. I haven't talked about the social/technical process of getting code merged into the Arrow repository.
