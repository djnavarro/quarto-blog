No, it was an impulsive decision. Was it a sensible way to spend the last Friday of 2022? Also no. Was it the kind of thing that will pay off in the long run through a deeper technical understanding of... something? Again, the answer is no. Ah, but will it impress people and make them think I am cool? Oh honey no. \n\nBut look...\n\n![](screenfetch.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n![](laptops.jpg){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n![](rstudio.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nNotes to myself on the process:\n\n- The installation guide ([https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide](wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide)) is good but dense, and I had to read a lot of the documents it links to in order to make progress. It took me three tries to get a working installation, because I missed some subtle thing (e.g., the first time I didn't have the bootable USB booting in UEFI mode, because *obviously* I would have thought of that at the beginning... sigh)\n- Everything became easier once I started feeling comfortable using [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/pacman).\n- The network configuration step gave me some grief. Eventually I got it to work when I installed [NetworkManager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager) and enabled `NetworkManager.service`, which in turn only made sense to me after I'd read about [start/enable](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Help:Reading#Control_of_systemd_units) and realised that \"starting\" a service sets it running in the background now, and \"enabling\" it means it will start automatically on startup\n- Toward the end of the installation it tells you to install a bootloader. I thought I wouldn't need to since I already had grub on my machine from the previous Ubuntu install but in the end it didn't work without going through the [GRUB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB) install process\n- During the initial installation I set up the root user, but no regular users. This article on [adding users on Arch Linux](https://linuxhint.com/add_users_arch_linux/) was helpful. Partly because it's a nice walkthrough, but also because it clued me into the fact that I needed to install [sudo](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/sudo) so that I could add the \"danielle\" account to the wheel group that can escalate to admin privileges using sudo.\n- I did think about other possible desktop environments, but in the end decided that I actually quite like [GNOME](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNOME) so I installed that. Unlike other linux installs I've had I decided not to have it automatically boot into GNOME. Instead I followed the instructions there so I could start it with `startx` as soon as I log in, or choose to stay in the shell\n- Best description on fonts I found was [this gist](https://gist.github.com/YoEight/d19112db56cd8f93835bf2d009d617f7). I have a suspicion that it's the [noto-fonts](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/noto-fonts/) package that does a lot of the work in fixing the issues\n- Fixing the touchpad scroll direction and speed was awkward too and I somehow got it to work after tinkering but I'm honestly not sure which thing made it work so... yeah, future Danielle, best of luck! \n\nGetting to the details...\n\n- Installing [R](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/r) is easy.\n- Other tools are trickier because they require you to install from the [Arch user repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/) (AUR). It's a good idea to read [the AUR guidelines](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository) before you start because there's a walkthrough on how to install a package from AUR... which is not straightforward. You have to copy the files locally, build the package, then install it with pacman. It's awkward. Plus there are dependencies you have to install first. \n- Once I had that, the [rstudio-desktop-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rstudio-desktop-bin) package was the one I installed. The only issue I had is that there's an unlisted dependency: you have to install `openssl-1.1` to make it work\n- Quarto I installed from the [quarto-cli](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/quarto-cli) package. That seems to work fine too\n\n<!--------------- appendices go here ----------------->\n\n\n",
