My notes while working through *Professional C++ (5th edition)* by Marc Gregoire

- C++ source code in `src` folder
- Binaries written to `bin` (not included)
- Markdown is the `notes` folder
- HTML output in `docs` folder
- Pandoc template for HTML output in `pandoc` folder
- `Makefile` handles C++ compilation and builds docs
