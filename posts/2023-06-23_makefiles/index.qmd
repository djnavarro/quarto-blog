<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->

<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

I have a secret to confess: I have been writing code for over 20 years, and until about a month ago I have been loathe even to try descending into the depths of the  [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)). For too long I have feared catastrophic implosion should I be reckless enough attempt to dive into these dark waters. Even now, as the sunlight fades and I pass below the surface into the treacherous realm of Almost Competence, I can hear the ominous sounds of compressive stress upon my psyche. I imagine betentacled krakenlike beasts of this realm outside the hull, the whispers of their hunting cry seeping into my tiny enclosed space as they call to the balrogs of open source...

> Well *actually*...

...they hiss at me.

Drums, drums in the deep. I cannot get out. I shall have to complete this blog post in the hope that a wizard and his merry little troupe of clueless hobbits may one day discover the tale of my tragic descent.

## Departing the Sunlit Uplands

Everything I know about Makefiles is from [makefiletutorial.com](https://makefiletutorial.com)

Let's do this.

```{bash}
./bin/species-first-pass
