<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
very_wide <- 500
wide <- 136
narrow <- 76
options(width = narrow)
cache_images <- TRUE
set.seed(1)
```

<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

At the end of last year I wrote a wrap-up post listing the things I'd done during 2022, ([A Very Strange Year](/posts/2022-12-26_strange-year/)), and perhaps I'll do another one for 2023.
