<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
set.seed(8)
long_slug <- "2023-01-09_CICD-spelling"
#renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
wide <- 136
narrow <- 76

As a data scientist or R programmer, you may be familiar with the benefits of version control systems like GitHub for tracking changes to your code base and collaborating with others.
But did you know that you can also use GitHub to automate the testing, building, and deployment of your R projects?
This process, known as continuous integration and deployment (CICD), can save you time and effort by ensuring that your code is always in a deploy-able state and by automatically delivering new updates to your users.
In this blog post, we will show you how to set up CICD for your quarto documents on GitHub, including configuring a build pipeline and integrating a spelling checker.
By the end of this tutorial, you will have a workflow in place that helps you catch spelling mistakes before they make it into your final documents.

## CICD

CICD is often used in GitHub projects for package development where it helps to maintain a certain code-quality and style consistency across different contributors and developers.
For R projects other than packages CICD is used much less frequently.
I belief that setting up CICD pipelines for less complex projects with only very few contributors is still useful to ensure consistent style, spelling, and more.

As I am occasionally involved in creating teaching materials in R using quarto, I wanted to implement some CICD checks for quarto documents.
As most out-of-the-box CICD pipelines are designed for package development, existing pipelines needed some adjustment to work with other R projects.

## Aim

When creating teaching materials in R I rely on GitHub for version control.
Generally, I have a `main`-branch which deploys to a GitHub-page displaying the rendered content.
The development of materials happens on the `devel` branch with a pending merge request to the `main` branch.
Whenever a chapter or a section is ready to be published, I merge the branches.
I wanted to create a pipeline that runs a spell-check on all my quarto files on the merge request with `main`, i.e.: Whenever I push to `devel` I want GitHub to run the CICD pipeline to check my spelling.
As an example, I will show how to implement spelling CICD on this blog-project. 

## Spell-check

Because R is all I know, I would like to use an R-package to do the spell-checking. 
The `spelling` package is well suited for the task, as it allows to spell-check all files at once. 
Before we try to implement the CICD pipeline, the spell-checker has to work locally, so we first install and load the package: 

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages(spelling)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(spelling)
```
If you are working on a package, you can directly use the function `spell_check_package()` and the `spelling` package will do so.
If you are working on any other R project you have to use the `spell_check_files()` function and you have to include a path to the files you want to check. 
Let's check just this file:
```{r}
#2023-01-09_CICD-spelling/
spelling::spell_check_files(path = "index.qmd")
```
It looks like there are a few words that spelling did not recognize, mostly file extensions, my last name, and the word *CICD* (which apparently I overuse).
We should carefully look through this list and decide, whether any mistakes were made.
We would not want the GitHub action to prohibit a merge request for any of these words, as there are no typos present (I hope).
Therefore, we want to add these words to a file that include words to be ignored by the `spelling` package. 

If you are working on a package, this is easy, you can use the `spelling::update_wordlist()` function.
We simply save the list of words as a *.txt* file.
For now, we save it in the working directory. 

```{r}
write(spelling::spell_check_files(path = "index.qmd")[[1]], "wordlist.txt")
```
The file looks like this: 
```{r}
read_lines("wordlist.txt")
```
Now we can tell `spelling` to ignore the words in this file from typo-detection:
```{r}
spelling::spell_check_files(path = "index.qmd", 
                            ignore = read_lines("wordlist.txt"))
```
- link to the package description spelling

```{r}
list.files(path = "../..", recursive = TRUE, pattern = )
```




## Setup
To implement GitHub CICD I create a folder `.github` in the project directory, and the folder `workflows` within the `.github` folder. 
This is where I store my CICD pipelines.
