<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
set.seed(8)
long_slug <- "2022-12-22_queue"
#renv::use(lockfile = "renv.lock")
```

Look if you want to do this right, you go look at [futureverse.org](https://www.futureverse.org/). The [future](https://future.futureverse.org/) package provides a fabulous way to execute R code asynchronously and in parallel. There are many excellent packages built on top of that.^[Note to self: Learn [parallelly](https://www.jottr.org/2022/12/05/avoid-detectcores/)] Along similar lines, if you find yourself with a burning need to analyze terabytes of data with R then babe it might be time to start learning some R workflows using [Spark](https://therinspark.com/), [Arrow](https://blog.djnavarro.net/category/apachearrow), [Kubernetes](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2022/04/wtf-is-kubernetes-and-should-i-care-as-r-user/), and various other eldritch tokens of power that figured rather more prominently in my life than one might expect for a simple country girl.^[`kubectl auth can-i create occult-chaos`] 

That's been said now. Good. We can put aside all pretension.
