The [Population Approach Group of Australia and New Zealand](https://www.paganz.org/) host some useful [resources](https://www.paganz.org/resources/) for folks interested in pharmacometric modelling. Specifically they have a series of workshops are pretty handy. There's a beginner workshop in 2019 that covers the core approach, and then two intermediate workshops in 2021 and 2022. I'll work through the [2019 workshop materials](https://www.paganz.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/PAWs-Beginners-2019.zip) in this blog post, translating the code from NONMEM to Stan and R as needed.
