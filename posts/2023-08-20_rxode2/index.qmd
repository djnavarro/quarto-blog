<!--------------- my typical setup ----------------->

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| include: false
very_wide <- 500
wide <- 136
narrow <- 76
options(width = narrow)
cache_images <- TRUE
set.seed(1)
```

<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

Preface goes here.

## Installation

Getting started with rxode2 is -- in theory -- perfectly straightforward. It's on CRAN, so you can install with:

``` r
install.packages("rxode2")
```

Unfortunately, like most R packages that allow you to compile C/C++/Fortran/Rust/Your-Favourite-Language-Here code, it relies heavily on system dependencies that you may or may not have, and managing the build tools is an OS-specific thing. I'm running Ubuntu 22.04, and (for reasons that don't bear mentioning) I recently did a "factory reset"^[Does that term even make sense for a linux machine? It's not like the thing shipped with linux in the first place. Whatever.] and did a fresh install of Ubuntu. So, yeah, I didn't have everything I needed. Yes, I did have the `gcc` compiler installed, but that's not the only system dependency you have to care about. In my case, I was missing `gfortran`, `libblas`, and `liblapack`. As a consequence, when I tried to run the example code on the package website, all I got was a long stream of error messages. In order to get started, I had to do this: 

``` bash
sudo apt install gfortran libblas-dev liblapack-dev liblapack-doc
```

That worked for me.
