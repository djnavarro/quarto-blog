<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

Hello there fellow data science person. Have you heard rumours that a lot of folks from our community are moving to use mastodon for social networking? Are you curious, but maybe not quite sure about how to get started? Have you been thinking "twitter is a hellsite and I need to escape" a lot lately? 

If yes, this post is for you! 

It's written from the time-tested pedagogical perspective of "the writer who is only one chapter ahead of her audience in the textbook". I've been on mastodon for a few days, but this isn't my first rodeo over there: I signed up for it very early on several years ago, and tried again a few years after that. This time I'm a lot more enthusiastic about it than the last two, so I'm writing a quick introductory post to help my fellow data science folks test out the waters. I sort of know what I'm doing there but not completely!

If you want a more detailed guide on navigating Mastodon and the fediverse, I recommend [fedi.tips](https://fedi.tips/). There's a lot of answers to common questions over there, from someone who actually does know what they are doing! Alternatively you can read [this thread](
https://mastodon.nz/@explorergrace/109272759764872091) which covers a lot of the same things I'm saying here!

Okay, let's dive in...


## What is Mastodon? What is the fediverse?

If you're entirely new to this, your mental model of mastodon is probably something like "mastodon is an open source twitter clone". To a first approximation that's right, but if you want to really feel at home there you're going to want to refine that mental model in a few ways. Mastodon is very similar to twitter in design, but there are some important differences

First off, mastodon is not a single application: it's a distributed network of servers that all talk to each other using a shared protocol.^[The most widely used protocol is called [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub), but we don't have to care about that here. Similarly, while mastodon is the most widely used application built on top of ActivityPub, there are others: [pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) is an instagram-like application built on ActivityPub, and pixelfed servers are also considered part of the fediverse.] If two servers talk to each other they are said to be "federated" with one another, and the network as a whole is referred to as the "fediverse". 

There are many different servers out there that are independently running mastodon: these are called **mastodon instances**. You can sign up for an account at one or more of these servers. The most popular instance is [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/), but for reasons I'll talk about in a moment this might not be the best choice for you! For example, my primary account is on [fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/) and my art-only account is on an instance for generative artists, [genart.social](https://genart.social/).

Fortunately, it usually doesn't matter too much which instance you pick: the servers all communicate with each other so you can follow people on different servers, talk with them, etc, and it's entirely possible to migrate your account from one server to another (I'll talk about that later in the post). It's only when you get into the details that it starts to matter!

## Terminology: Toots and boosts

Posts on twitter are called "tweets" and have a 280 character limit. Posts on mastodon are called "toots" and have a 500 character limit. If you're thinking of making a joke about "haha it's called tooting" well fine, but there's a pretty good chance that everyone has already heard it. Very few of us are actually that original :-) 

Sharing someone else's post on twitter is called a "retweet". The mastodon equivalent is called "boosting". One deliberate design choice on mastodon is that there is no analog of "quote retweeting": you can either boost someone else's toot and you can post your own. You can't share someone else's post to your own followers with your commentary added. I'll talk about the logic for that later: it's critical to understanding the culture on mastodon. 

## Mastodon handles and tags look like email addresses

On twitter, you simply have a username: I'm [djnavarro](https://twitter.com/djnavarro) there, and people would tag me into a conversation by typing **@djnavarro**. 

On mastodon, you have to specify both your username and the server. It's more like an email address. My primary handle on mastodon is [djnavarro@fosstodon.org]([djnavarro@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@djnavarro)) and people can tag me into a conversation by typing **@djnavarro@fosstodon.org**.

## Is there a data science community there?

Yes! There's definitely a data science community there. It's much smaller than the one on twitter and things tend to move at a slightly slower pace, but there are some advantages. 

You can find your data science friends by searching for hashtags. R folks will quickly find other R users posting with the **#rstats** hashtag, but you can also find **#TidyTuesday** and other familiar hashtags. I'll talk about this more later, but hashtags are much more useful (and more important) on mastodon than they are on twitter. The interface for hashtags is basically the same as twitter: you can search for them in the search box (see interface section below), hashtags are clickable links, etc. 

Once you've found some people, you can find more by taking a look at who they follow and who follows them. Again, the interface for that is essentially the same as twitter: click on someone's profile, and you'll be able to find a list of people they follow and the people who follow them. However, what you will often finds is that these lists are incomplete: generally, the *follower counts* are accurate, but servers only publish the list of account names for accounts on that server.^[I'm guessing that happens to optimise bandwidth usage?]

Finally, when you're ready to get started you can make an introduction post: all you have to do is send out a post tagged with **#introduction**. With any luck that will be picked up 

## Which server should I sign up on?

There's a nicely [server list at fediscience.org](https://fediscience.org/server-list.html) that has some commentaries. Here's a few possibilities you might consider:

- [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social): The largest instance. It's general interest, so you get a reasonably diverse audience. However it's also the focal point so any time there's a wave of migrations from twitter it will probably be the first one to show performance hits.

- [fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org): An instance with a focus on open source software. There are a lot of tech people on this one, which means you can watch the local timeline scroll by (more on that coming!) and see lots of random techy posts.

- [fediscience.org](https://fediscience.org): A science focused instance, including natural and social sciences.

- [vis.social](https://vis.social): Lots of cool data visualisation folks here.

- [tech.lgbt](https://tech.lgbt): An instance for folks who work in tech, science, academia, etc who are LGBTIQ or allies.  

For any server, you should look carefully at the server rules that will be posted on the "About" page. Each server has different policies that will affect moderation. Don't sign up for vis.social if you want to post about NFTs (I'll talk about NFTs later actually), and don't join fosstodon.org if you want to post in languages other than English. Don't join any of these servers if you want to post anti-trans content.^[Yes there are servers where transphobia is permitted, but they aren't common and are typically blocked at the server level because server admins just don't want to deal with bigotry directed at their users. Weird huh?]

Take a little time to look around but don't worry about the choice too much. You can move your account across servers without too much difficulty if you need to, and I'll show you how later in the post.


## Can you tell me about the web interface?

Okay so you've decided on a server, signed up for an account, and are ready to get started. Let's take a look at the interface!

For the purposes of this post I'll assume you're looking to get started by using the web interface. There are, unsurprisingly, apps you can download onto your phone (e.g., I'm using the standard mastodon app on iOS), but I'm trying not to complicate things in this post so let's assume you're using your laptop and are browsing through the web interface!

My main account is [djnavarro@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@djnavarro). In my browser I'm logged in already, so when I navigate to [fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org) I'm automatically shown the logged in view. There are two versions you can choose between, the "standard view" and the "advanced view".

The "standard view" interface looks pretty similar to what you'd expect from twitter. On the left you can write posts, in the middle there's a column where your feed is shown (I've edited these screenshots to remove the actual posts, just so we can focus on interface), and on the right sidebar there's a menu with various options you can click on:

![](./img/standard_view.png)

In a lot of cases this view will work well for you, but if you want to track hashtags -- more on that later because hashtags are important! -- you might find it useful to switch to the "advanced view". To switch, click on the "Preferences" option on the right hand side, which brings up a preferences screen that looks like this:

![](./img/appearance_settings.png)

Click on the "Enable advanced web interface" option, like I've done here, and click save changes. When you then go back to mastodon, the interface will have changed to one that looks very similar to the Tweetdeck interface that a lot of folks on Twitter use:

![](img/advanced_view.png)
There are more columns. As before, the left column shows an aread where you can compose posts, and on the right column a menu with options is shown. Posts will appear in the "Home" column. Mentions, favourites (similar to Twitter "likes"), and boosts (similar to Twitter retweets), will be shown in the "Notifications" column. 

## How do I make a post?

Writing a post on mastodon is similar to how you would write a post on twitter. The compose window looks like this:

![](img/compose.png)

You type the text you want into the box, adding hashtags, and then click the "Toot!" button (it may look different on your instance -- I've seen the same button labelled "Post" sometimes). As you type, you'll see the character count in the bottom right corner change to let you know how many characters you have left: you're allowed 500 characters for a post on mastodon. 

The nuances are important though. Those other buttons on the bottom left... those are all useful features. From left to right:

- The paperclip button: clicking this will let you attach an image. When you do, there will be an option to edit the image and (especially important!) to add alt text for accessibility purposes. Mastodon has a stronger norm about alt text than twitter: *always* add alt text. I have a section on alt text later in this post.

- The barchart button: this will let you add a poll. Polls on mastodon work similarly to twitter, but are a bit more flexible. You can add more options and let users select multiple options. 

- The world button: this will let you set the visibility for the post. If you click on it you will see four options: "public" means everyone can view it, "unlisted" means everyone can view it but it doesn't get indexed by discovery features (very handy in replies and threads where you don't want everyone to be automatically shown your comment), "followers only" means only your followers can see it, and "mentioned people only" means only the people mentioned can see it (this is effectively how direct messages work on mastodon)


## Why are hashtags so important?

## Tracking hashtags

So you want to follow a hashtag? Good news, you can! From what I can tell, this is something where your options might be a little different on each server. For instance, on mastodon.social you can follow a hashtag directly in the standard view: when you search for a hashtag there will be a little "follow" icon that appears that you can click on (see [this comment on fedi.tips](https://fedi.tips/how-to-use-mastodon-and-the-fediverse-advanced-tips/#FollowingHashtags)). When you do that, posts with that hashtag will appear in your feed. However, not every server implements this: fosstodon.org doesn't do that right now. 

So let's go with a method that seems to work everywhere I've looked.

https://mastodon.nz/@thoughtfulnz/109278289508807509

You'll need to be in "advanced view" (the one with lots of columns, see earlier) to do this. You can customise your view by adding columns corresponding to hashtags you want to follow. For example, let's say I want to follow the **#rstats** hashtag. The first thing I'd do is type **#rstats** into the search bar (in the top left corner). The results will be shown directly below the search bar, like this:

![](img/searching_hashtag.png)

These are clickable links. When I click on the **#rstats** hashtag in the results, a new column appears... containing a chronological feed that consists of posts tagged with **#rstats**:

![](./img/rstats_column.png)

Again, in real life this won't be empty: you'll actually see the posts! You are now tracking **#rstats** on mastodon, albeit temporarily. 

Suppose you want to make sure the column sticks around every time you open mastodon. We can "pin" the column in place. To do that, I click on the little "settings" icon at the top right of the **#rstats** column. It's the one on the far right here:

![](./img/rstats_column_menu.png)

When you do that, you will see a small menu that gives you the option to pin! Easy.

We can make our **#rstats** column more useful. For example, there are several hashtags I want to bundle together when following R content: **#TidyTuesday**, **#TidyModels**, and **#ggplot2**. I don't want a separate column for each one, I want to group them into a single feed. Click on that little settings button again. Now you'll see a richer menu:

![](img/add_hashtags.png)

One of the options there is "include additional tags". When I click on that, I can type in the other hashtags to track: 

![](img/multitag.png)
And now we are done! I have a feed that tracks R related content on mastodon.

## Are mastodon favourites the same as twitter likes?

Almost, but not entirely. The big difference is that mastodon implementation is far, far better and not deceptive. This is something I feel very strongly about!

On twitter, we've all become accustomed to the obnoxious fact that "likes" do two different things: they send a signal to the person that you liked what they said (i.e., what they're supposed to do!), but whenever you do that it will trigger a stochastic retweet: some proportion of people who follow you will also see that tweet because you liked it. This is annoying because very often you actually enjoy a thing but don't think it is appropriate to retweet. 

Twitter doesn't respect your boundaries. The fact that I like something is not an act in which I give twitter permission to share that fact to other people. It's abusive behaviour by twitter.

Mastodon doesn't do anything like that. Favourites don't trigger anything. They do *exactly* the thing they claim to do: they are a mechanism by which you can communicate to the other person "hey I liked this!" So you should use favourites a lot! Show people you appreciate them! 

Quite separate from that, if you think this is something your followers would appreciate seeing, then boost it too! The key thing is that on mastodon the two functions are separated cleanly... do both when both are appropriate, do one when one is appropriate. You are in control of your sharing behaviour here. 



## What are the local and federated timelines?

## How do I move my account to a new server?

In hindsight, I realise I missed a step...

### Step 0: Prepare the way

1. It's probably a good idea to post from your old account that you're about to initiate a move. That way people will not be surprised when they find themselves following a new account
2. Set up your avatar, bio, etc on the new account using the same (or similar) images and descriptions on the old account: anyone who clicks through on the new account will see that it's you!

### Step 1: Import and export from the old account

1. Click on the "preferences" options
2. Within preferences, select "import and export"
3. On the data export page, you'll see a list of possible csv files you can download. Download the ones you want, especially the "follows" csv.


### Step 2: Set up alias on the new account

1. Click on the "preferences" options
2. Within preferences, select "account"
3. On the account settings page, scroll down to the bottom to the section called "moving from a different account" and click on the link "create an account alias"
4. On the account aliases page, specify the handle of your old account -- e.g., djnavarro@mastodon.social in my case -- and click "create alias"

You're done: the alias is set up. You may have to wait a while for this to propagate to the old account. When I moved I had to wait overnight because mastodon.social was running very slowly due to the massive spike of new users from twitter. 

### Step 3: Initiate the move from the old account

1. Click on the "preferences" options
2. Within preferences, select "account"
3. On the account settings page, scroll down to the bottom to the section called "moving to a different account" and click on the link "configure it here"
4. On the moving accounts page, type the handle of the new account -- in my case djnavarro@fosstodon.org -- and enter the password for your old account to confirm. Click "move followers". 

This will initiate the move. All your followers at the old account will automatically unfollow the old account and then follow the new one. It'll take a little while and it might happen in bursts.

### Step 4: Import your follos at the new account 

1. Click on the "preferences" options
2. Within preferences, select "import and export"
3. On the menu on the left, click the "import" submenu
4. On the import screen, select the import type (e.g., "following list"), click on "browse" to select the csv file you exported earlier, and then click "upload".

Your new account will now automatically follow all the accounts your old account followed. 


## Etiquette on alt-text?

On twitter, you've probably found that there's some pressure and expectation to supply alt-text for your images. The norm is much stronger on Mastodon.
