Hi there! I'm a data scientist, an R developer, and a generative artist. In my day job I work as developer advocate and software engineer at [Voltron Data](https://voltrondata.com). In former lifetime I was an academic, working as a computational cognitive scientist at [UNSW Sydney](https://unsw.edu.au). In my happier moments I make art from code.
